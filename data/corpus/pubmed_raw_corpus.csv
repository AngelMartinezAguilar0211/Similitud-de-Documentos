10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01635-6	The global, regional, and national burden of cancer, 1990-2023, with forecasts to       2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.		Cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Accurate cancer burden       information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have       up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we       used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023       framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types       or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023,       cancer burden attributable to selected risk factors from 1990 to 2023, and       forecasted cancer burden up to 2050. Cancer estimation in GBD 2023 used       data from population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration       systems, and verbal autopsies. Cancer mortality was estimated using ensemble       models, with incidence informed by mortality estimates and mortality-to-incidence       ratios (MIRs). Prevalence estimates were generated from modelled survival       estimates, then multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with       disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying       age-specific cancer deaths by the GBD standard life expectancy at the age of       death. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs       and YLDs. We used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate       cancer burden attributable to 44 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and       metabolic risk factors. To forecast cancer burden from 2024 to 2050, we used the       GBD 2023 forecasting framework, which included forecasts of relevant risk factor       exposures and used Socio-demographic Index as a covariate for forecasting the       proportion of each cancer not affected by these risk factors. Progress towards       the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 aim to reduce       non-communicable disease mortality by a third between 2015 and 2030 was estimated       for cancer. In 2023, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, there were       18·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 16·4 to 20·7) incident cases of cancer and       10·4 million (9·65 to 10·9) deaths, contributing to 271 million (255 to 285)       DALYs globally. Of these, 57·9% (56·1 to 59·8) of incident cases and 65·8% (64·3       to 67·6) of cancer deaths occurred in low-income to upper-middle-income countries       based on World Bank income group classifications. Cancer was the second leading       cause of deaths globally in 2023 after cardiovascular diseases. There were 4·33       million (3·85 to 4·78) risk-attributable cancer deaths globally in 2023,       comprising 41·7% (37·8 to 45·4) of all cancer deaths. Risk-attributable cancer       deaths increased by 72·3% (57·1 to 86·8) from 1990 to 2023, whereas overall       global cancer deaths increased by 74·3% (62·2 to 86·2) over the same period. The       reference forecasts (the most likely future) estimate that in 2050 there will be       30·5 million (22·9 to 38·9) cases and 18·6 million (15·6 to 21·5) deaths from       cancer globally, 60·7% (41·9 to 80·6) and 74·5% (50·1 to 104·2) increases from       2024, respectively. These forecasted increases in deaths are greater in       low-income and middle-income countries (90·6% [61·0 to 127·0]) compared with       high-income countries (42·8% [28·3 to 58·6]). Most of these increases are likely       due to demographic changes, as age-standardised death rates are forecast to       change by -5·6% (-12·8 to 4·6) between 2024 and 2050 globally. Between 2015 and       2030, the probability of dying due to cancer between the ages of 30 years and 70       years was forecasted to have a relative decrease of 6·5% (3·2 to 10·3).       Cancer is a major contributor to global disease burden, with       increasing numbers of cases and deaths forecasted up to 2050 and a       disproportionate growth in burden in countries with scarce resources. The decline       in age-standardised mortality rates from cancer is encouraging but insufficient       to meet the SDG target set for 2030. Effectively and sustainably addressing       cancer burden globally will require comprehensive national and international       efforts that consider health systems and context in the development and       implementation of cancer-control strategies across the continuum of prevention,       diagnosis, and treatment.

10.4049/jimmunol.173.5.2995	A novel mutation in CD83 results in the development of a unique population of       CD4+ T cells.	García-Martínez LF, Appleby MW, Staehling-Hampton K, Andrews DM, Chen Y, McEuen M, Tang P, Rhinehart RL, Proll S, Paeper B, Brunkow ME, Grandea AG 3rd, Howard ED, Walker DE, Charmley P, Jonas M, Shaw S, Latham JA, Ramsdell F	Using a mouse mutagenesis screen, we have identified CD83 as being critical for       the development of CD4(+) T cells and for their function postactivation. CD11c(+)       dendritic cells develop and function normally in mice with a mutated CD83 gene       but CD4(+) T cell development is substantially reduced. Additionally, we now show       that those CD4(+) cells that develop in a CD83 mutant animal fail to respond       normally following allogeneic stimulation. This is at least in part due to an       altered cytokine expression pattern characterized by an increased production of       IL-4 and IL-10 and diminished IL-2 production. Thus, in addition to its role in       selection of CD4(+) T cells, absence of CD83 results in the generation of cells       with an altered activation and cytokine profile.

10.1038/s41586-025-09588-6	Autoimmune response to C9orf72 protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Michaelis T, Lindestam Arlehamn CS, Johansson E, Frazier A, Berry JD, Cudkowicz M, Goyal NA, Fournier C, Snyder A, Kwan JY, Crook J, Phillips EJ, Mallal SA, Ravits J, Marder KS, Sidney J, Sulzer D, Sette A	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized       by a progressive loss of motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is apparent in affected       tissues, including increased T cell infiltration and activation of microglia,       particularly in the spinal cord(1,2). Autoimmune responses are thought to have a       key role in ALS pathology, and it is hypothesized that T cells contribute to the       rapid loss of neurons during disease progression(3,4). However, until now there       has been no reported target for such an autoimmune response. Here we show that       ALS is associated with recognition of the C9orf72 antigen, and we map the       specific epitopes that are recognized. We show that these responses are mediated       by CD4(+) T cells that preferentially release IL-5 and IL-10, and that       IL-10-mediated T cell responses are significantly greater in donors who have a       longer predicted survival time. Our results reinforce the previous hypothesis       that neuroinflammation has an important role in ALS disease progression, possibly       because of a disrupted balance of inflammatory and counter-inflammatory T cell       responses(4). These findings highlight the potential of therapeutic strategies       aimed at enhancing regulatory T cells(5), and identify a key target for       antigen-specific T cell responses that could enable precision therapeutics in       ALS.

10.1038/s41573-025-01291-5	In vivo chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy.	Bot A, Scharenberg A, Friedman K, Guey L, Hofmeister R, Andorko JI, Klichinsky M, Neumann F, Shah JV, Swayer AJ, Trudeau K, Weissman D, Stephan MT, Buchholz CJ, June CH	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed the outcomes of       patients with haematological malignancies, yet its use is limited by       labour-intensive manufacturing, constrained production capacity and variable       clinical performance. In vivo CAR-T cell engineering, in which CAR-T cells are       generated directly inside the patient's body, seeks to overcome these challenges       by eliminating the need for ex vivo cell processing and complex logistics, as       well as improve clinical performance. Recent advances in virology, RNA medicines       and nanotechnology have catalysed a radical overhaul of this approach, which uses       targeted delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors and lipid nanoparticles to       introduce CAR-encoding genetic material into endogenous T cells. Early clinical       studies have shown efficient transduction, sustained CAR expression and initial       signs of antitumour activity, establishing proof of concept. This Review explores       the underlying technologies - including RNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles and       engineered viral vectors - and discusses how they are being adapted to develop       more broadly applicable, scalable, safe and effective CAR-T cell therapies. By       removing the need for ex vivo manipulation and chemotherapeutic conditioning,       this strategy could enable the wider application of CAR-T cell therapies not just       to blood cancers but to autoimmune diseases for which ex vivo CAR-T cell       therapies have shown strong promise, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

10.2147/NSS.S467531	Effects of Acute Sleep Deprivation on Sporting Performance in Athletes: A       Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Gong M, Sun M, Sun Y, Jin L, Li S	Using meta-analysis to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the       impact of acute sleep deprivation on different sports performance of athletes,       this study aims to provide scientific guidance for coaches in optimizing and       adjusting training and competition arrangements. Establishing literature       inclusion and exclusion criteria, we conducted searches in both Chinese and       English databases. Using stata 14.0, we analyzed 75 indicators from 27 included       literature, focusing on three aspects: the impact of acute sleep deprivation on       overall athletic performance, the impact on sporting performance across various       athletic abilities, and the disparities in athletic performance between morning       and afternoon following acute sleep deprivation. The effect size of       acute sleep deprivation on overall athletic performance was -0.56 (P<0.05).       Sub-analyses revealed effect sizes of -0.23 (P<0.05) for whole night sleep       deprivation, -1.17 (P<0.05) for partial sleep deprivation at the end of the       night, and -0.25 (P>0.05) for partial sleep deprivation in the beginning of the       night. The effect sizes of acute sleep deprivation on high intensity intermittent       exercise, skill control, speed, aerobic endurance, and explosive power indicators       were -1.57, -1.06, -0.67, -0.54, and -0.39 respectively (P<0.05). The effect       sizes of acute sleep deprivation on the overall athletic performance in the       morning and afternoon were -0.30, and -1.11, respectively (P<0.05). Acute sleep deprivation significantly impairs the overall athletic performance of       athletes, with a more pronounced negative impact observed with partial sleep       deprivation at the end of the night. Various types of exercise performance are       adversely affected by acute sleep deprivation, with magnitude of impact ranking       high intensity intermittent, skill control, speed, aerobic endurance, and       explosive power. Following acute sleep deprivation, athletes' overall sporting       performance in the afternoon is inferior to that in the morning.	Nature and science of sleep	01/01/2024
10.1016/0022-2836(88)90482-2	Selection of DNA binding sites by regulatory proteins. II. The binding       specificity of cyclic AMP receptor protein to recognition sites.	Berg OG, von Hippel PH	"The statistics of base-pair usage within known recognition sites for a particular       DNA-binding protein can be used to estimate the relative protein binding       affinities to these sites, as well as to sites containing any other combinations       of base-pairs. As has been described elsewhere, the connection between base-pair       statistics and binding free energy is made by an equal probability selection       assumption; i.e. that all base-pair sequences that provide appropriate binding       strength are equally likely to have been chosen as recognition sites in the       course of evolution. This is analogous to a statistical-mechanical system where       all configurations with the same energy are equally likely to occur. In this       communication, we apply the statistical-mechanical selection theory to analyze       the base-pair statistics of the known recognition sequences for the cyclic AMP       receptor protein (CRP). The theoretical predictions are found to be in reasonable       agreement with binding data for those sequences for which experimental binding       information is available, thus lending support to the basic assumptions of the       selection theory. On the basis of this agreement, we can predict the affinity for       CRP binding to any base-pair sequence, albeit with a large statistical       uncertainty. When the known recognition sites for CRP are ranked according to       predicted binding affinities, we find that the ranking is consistent with the       hypothesis that the level of function of these sites parallels their fractional       saturation with CRP-cAMP under in-vivo conditions. When applied to the entire       genome, the theory predicts the existence of a large number of randomly occurring       ""pseudosites"" with strong binding affinity for CRP. It appears that most CRP       molecules are engaged in non-productive binding at non-specific or pseudospecific       sites under in-vivo conditions. In this sense, the specificity of the CRP binding       site is very low. Relative specificity requirements for polymerases, repressors       and activators are compared in light of the results of this and the first paper       in this series."

10.1038/s41591-025-03978-z	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of       pharmacological treatments for obesity in adults.	McGowan B, Ciudin A, Baker JL, Busetto L, Dicker D, Frühbeck G, Goossens GH, Monami M, Sbraccia P, Martinez-Tellez B, Woodward E, Yumuk V	This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and       safety of obesity management medications (OMMs) in terms of reducing body weight       and impact on obesity-related complications. Here a Medline and Embase search was       performed up to 31 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing OMMs       versus placebo/active comparators in adults. Primary endpoint was percentage of       total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were       TBWL% at 1, 2 and ≥3 years, lipid profile, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c,       fasting plasma glucose, mental health, serious adverse events, quality of life,       cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remission of obesity-related       complications and all-cause mortality. Fifty-six clinical trials were       identified-orlistat (22), semaglutide (14), liraglutide (11), tirzepatide (6),       naltrexone/bupropion (5) and phentermine/topiramate (2)-enrolling 60,307 patients       (32,598 OMM and 27,709 placebo). All OMMs showed a significantly greater TBWL%       versus placebo (P < 0.0001), more than 10% for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Both       tirzepatide and semaglutide showed normoglycemia restoration, remission of type 2       diabetes and reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure. Semaglutide was       effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing pain in       knee osteoarthritis. Tirzepatide was effective in remission of obstructive sleep       apnea syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. These       results support the need to individualize the selection of OMMs.	Nature medicine	02/10/2025
10.1186/s13058-025-02123-5	Hsa-miR-155-5p expression in primary breast tissue may have the potential for       prediction of breast cancer brain recurrence: results from the       multi-institutional exploratory cohort study.	Koyama Y, Muguruma M, Horimoto Y, Narui K, Yamada A, Yamada K, Yamamoto S, Orihara S, Kaise H, Kogure A, Yoshioka Y, Ochiya T, Ishikawa T	Despite the known incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer, no       useful biomarker has been clinically established for breast cancer brain       metastasis (BCBM). In the present study, we aimed to examine the expression of       microRNAs (miRNAs) related to BCBM in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)       tissues to identify their usefulness as predictive biomarkers of breast cancer       brain recurrence (BCBR). Pairs of primary breast and metastatic site       tissue samples were collected from 38 patients who experienced the first       recurrence of metastasis to a single distant organ       (brain/lungs/liver/bones = 11/12/9/6 patients) between January 2007 and December       2021 at five institutions in Japan. We evaluated the expression of 15 miRNAs in       FFPE specimens of untreated breast and metastatic sites from the same patient       using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Analysis of the selected       15 miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-155-5p exhibited significant BCBR-specific       overexpression in untreated primary breast tissues (p < 0.001). Two other miRNAs,       hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-20b-5p, exhibited moderate (ρ = 0.587) and weak       (ρ = 0.350) positive correlations with hsa-miR-155-5p, respectively. The BCBR       prediction model demonstrated a high discrimination ability for hsa-miR-155-5p       (AUC = 0.960). The localization of hsa-miR-155-5p in primary breast cancer tissue       by in situ hybridization confirmed that hsa-miR-155-5p was uniformly stained in       the breast cancer cells. Hsa-miR-155-5p expression in untreated       primary breast tissue may be a valuable biomarker for predicting BCBR. A       personalized escalation strategy is expected to be helpful in conquering brain       metastases.	Breast cancer research : BCR	29/09/2025
10.1038/s41593-025-02062-6	Muscle-derived miR-126 regulates TDP-43 axonal local synthesis and NMJ integrity       in ALS models.	Ionescu A, Ankol L, Ganapathy Subramaniam A, Altman T, Magen I, Cohen Y, Danino Y, Gradus-Pery T, Niv Y, Bar Avi O, Geller D, Ibraheem A, Cheng R, Steinberg N, Alfahel L, Duc P, Ergul-Ulger Z, Arslan D, Tan E, Rage F, Riva N, Quattrini A, Bekircan-Kurt CE, Israelson A, Dori A, Hornstein E, Perlson E	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by neuromuscular junction       (NMJ) disruption and neurodegeneration. Recent findings highlight a pivotal role       for TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in forming axonal pathological       condensates and facilitating NMJ disruption through inhibition of local protein       synthesis. However, the mechanisms that drive local TDP-43 accumulation remain       unknown. Here we identify that the TDP-43 axonal accumulation in peripheral       nerves of SOD1 patients and mice stems from its aberrant local synthesis. This is       a non-cell-autonomous process driven by muscle-derived miR-126a-5p extracellular       vesicles (EVs). Inhibiting muscle secretion of miR-126a-5p prompts presynaptic       TDP-43 synthesis and accumulation, which disrupts axonal translation and causes       NMJ degeneration. Introducing miR-126 to SOD1(G93A) mice, primary co-cultures and       human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived co-cultures with ALS mutations       exhibits neuroprotective effects and delays motor decline. These findings       identify a transcellular communication axis between muscles and motor neurons       that regulates axonal local synthesis and NMJ maintenance, offering insights into       ALS onset and progression.

10.1002/ajmg.10401	A 52-kb deletion in the SOST-MEOX1 intergenic region on 17q12-q21 is associated       with van Buchem disease in the Dutch population.	Staehling-Hampton K, Proll S, Paeper BW, Zhao L, Charmley P, Brown A, Gardner JC, Galas D, Schatzman RC, Beighton P, Papapoulos S, Hamersma H, Brunkow ME	Van Buchem disease is an autosomal recessive sclerosing bone dysplasia       characterized by skeletal hyperostosis, overgrowth of the mandible, and a       liability to entrapment of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves. The genetic       determinant maps to chromosome 17q12-q21. We refined the critical interval to the       < 1-Mb region between D17S2250 and D17S2253 in 15 affected individuals, all of       whom shared a common disease haplotype. Furthermore, we report here the       identification of a 52-kb deletion located within the interval and encompassing       D17S1789 that is 100% concordant with the disorder. Although the deletion itself       does not appear to disrupt the coding region of any known or novel gene(s), the       closest flanking genes are MEOX1 on the proximal side, and SOST on the distal       side of the deletion. MEOX1 is known to be important for the development of the       axial skeleton, whereas the SOST gene is the determinant of sclerosteosis, a       disorder that shares many features with van Buchem disease, thus raising the       possibility that van Buchem disease results from dysregulation of the expression       of one or both of these genes.

10.1186/s12933-025-02939-7	Joint effects of triglyceride glucose index and its obesity-related derivatives       with estimated glucose disposal rate on cardiometabolic multimorbidity in       middle-aged and older Chinese adults: a nationwide cohort study.	Ruan X, Ling Y, Chen J, Xiang Y, Ruan H, Zhang W, Jing L, Gao X, He Y, Lu X, Chang T, Xu J, Chen J	The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI),       TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC), TyG-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR), and       estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) serve as surrogate markers of insulin       resistance (IR) and are associated with cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). However,       the joint effects of TyG-related indices and eGDR on cardiometabolic       multimorbidity (CMM) risk remains unclear. This study aims to assess both       separate and combined effects of TyG-related indices and eGDR on CMM. The data of this study derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal       Study (CHARLS). TyG-related indices and eGDR were dichotomized at their median       levels for participant categorization. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression       and restricted cubic splines (RCS) analyzed effects of TyG-related indices and       eGDR on CMM, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, net       reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement       (IDI) assessed their predictive performance. Meanwhile, the mutual mediating       effects and interaction effects were further assessed. This study       included 5,854 participants (male: 47.5%, median age: 57.0 years). Compared to       low TyG-related indices plus high eGDR, High TyG-related indices plus low eGDR       had elevated CMM risks: TyG (HR 3.59, 95% CI 2.28-5.65), TyG-BMI (HR 3.40, 95% CI       2.30-5.02), TyG-WC (HR 3.85, 95% CI 2.58-5.75), and TyG-WHtR (HR 3.62, 95% CI       2.43-5.39). Furthermore, the addition of TyG-related indices combined with eGDR       to the basic model significantly improved CMM risk prediction: TyG (AUC 0.713,       NRI 0.363, IDI 0.008, all p < 0.05); TyG-BMI (AUC 0.729, NRI 0.479, IDI 0.011,       all p < 0.05); TyG-WC (AUC 0.716, NRI 0.419, IDI 0.010, all p < 0.05); and       TyG-WHtR (AUC 0.717, NRI 0.379, IDI 0.010, all p < 0.05). Moreover, the mediation       analysis demonstrated that eGDR significantly mediated all TyG-related indices'       associations with CMM, with only obesity-related TyG indices mediating the       association between eGDR and CMM. Notably, no significant additive or       multiplicative interaction was observed between any TyG-related indices and eGDR       for CMM risk. High TyG-related indices and low eGDR were       independently and jointly associated with higher CMM risk. Joint application of       TyG-related indices and eGDR could improve early identification and prevention of       CMM.	Cardiovascular diabetology	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09539-1	Proteotoxic stress response drives T cell exhaustion and immune evasion.	Wang Y, Ma A, Song NJ, Shannon AE, Amankwah YS, Chen X, Wu W, Wang Z, Saadey AA, Yousif A, Ghosh G, Mandula JK, Velegraki M, Xiao T, Wen H, Huang SC, Wang R, Beusch CM, Dawood AS, Gordon DE, Abdel-Hakeem MS, Ghoneim HE, Xin G, Searle BC, Li Z	Chronic infections and cancer cause T cell dysfunction known as exhaustion. This       cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation       and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the       efficacy of immunotherapies(1-4). The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion       remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8(+) exhausted T       (T(ex)) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic       viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic       pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector       (T(eff)) and T(ex) cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response       (PSR) in T(ex) cells, which we term T(ex)-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress       responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis(5,6), T(ex)-PSR involves       an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized       chaperone proteins. T(ex)-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of       protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant       protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can       convert T(eff) cells to T(ex) cells, and we link T(ex)-PSR mechanistically to       persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of T(ex)-PSR-associated chaperones       in CD8(+) T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover,       a high T(ex)-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to       clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that T(ex)-PSR is a       hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the       possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer       immunotherapy.

10.1056/NEJMoa2508170	Sotatercept for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension within the First Year after       Diagnosis.	McLaughlin VV, Hoeper MM, Badesch DB, Ghofrani HA, Gibbs JSR, Gomberg-Maitland M, Preston IR, Souza R, Waxman AB, Kopeć G, Meyer G, Olsson KM, Fu W, Shi Y, Miller B, Kim SS, Mackenzie HS, Brambatti M, Patel MJ, Koglin J, Cornell AG, Humbert M	Sotatercept, an activin-signaling inhibitor, reduces morbidity and       mortality among patients with long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its       effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension within the first year       after diagnosis are unclear. In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled adult       patients with World Health Organization functional class II or III pulmonary       arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier,       had an intermediate or high risk of death, and were receiving double or triple       background therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive add-on therapy       with subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight;       escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 21 days. The       primary end point was clinical worsening, a composite of death from any cause,       unplanned hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours for worsening of pulmonary       arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, or deterioration       in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension,       assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. The trial was stopped early       owing to loss of clinical equipoise after the reporting of positive results from       previous sotatercept trials. A total of 320 patients were included (160 each in       the sotatercept and placebo groups). The median duration of follow-up was 13.2       months. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 17 patients (10.6%) in       the sotatercept group and in 59 patients (36.9%) in the placebo group (hazard       ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.41; P<0.001). Deterioration in       performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred       in 8 patients (5.0%) in the sotatercept group and in 46 patients (28.8%) in the       placebo group; unplanned hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial       hypertension occurred in 3 patients (1.9%) and 14 patients (8.8%), respectively;       and death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (4.4%) and 6 patients (3.8%). No       cases of atrial septostomy or lung transplantation occurred. The most common       adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis (31.9%) and telangiectasia       (26.2%). Among adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension who had       received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, the addition of sotatercept to       background therapy resulted in a lower risk of clinical worsening than placebo.

10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6312	The amount of scurfin protein determines peripheral T cell number and       responsiveness.	Khattri R, Kasprowicz D, Cox T, Mortrud M, Appleby MW, Brunkow ME, Ziegler SF, Ramsdell F	In the absence of the recently identified putative transcription factor scurfin,       mice develop a lymphoproliferative disorder resulting in death by 3 wk of age       from a pathology that resembles TGF-beta or CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this report,       we characterize mice that overexpress the scurfin protein and demonstrate that       these animals have a dramatically depressed immune system. Mice transgenic for       the Foxp3 gene (which encodes the scurfin protein) have fewer T cells than their       littermate controls, and those T cells that remain have poor proliferative and       cytolytic responses and make little IL-2 after stimulation through the TCR.       Although thymic development appears normal in these mice, peripheral lymphoid       organs, particularly lymph nodes, are relatively acellular. In a separate       transgenic line, forced expression of the gene specifically in the thymus can       alter thymic development; however, this does not appear to affect peripheral T       cells and is unable to prevent disease in mice lacking a functional Foxp3 gene,       indicating that the scurfin protein acts on peripheral T cells. The data indicate       a critical role for the Foxp3 gene product in the function of the immune system,       with both the number and functionality of peripheral T cells under the aegis of       the scurfin protein.

10.1016/j.jns.2024.123303	Multi-Omic characterization of the effects of Ocrelizumab in patients with       relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	Kornilov SA, Price ND, Gelinas R, Acosta J, Brunkow ME, Gervasi-Follmar T, Winger RC, Aldershoff D, Lausted C, Troisch P, Smith B, Heath JR, Repovic P, Cohan S, Magis AT	The study examined changes in the plasma proteome, metabolome, and lipidome of       N = 14 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) initiating       treatment with ocrelizumab, assayed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.       Analyses of >4000 circulating biomarkers identified depletion of B-cell       associated proteins as the early effect observed following ocrelizumab (OCR)       initiation, accompanied by the reduction in plasma abundance of cytokines and       cytotoxic proteins, markers of neuronaxonal damage, and biologically active       lipids including ceramides and lysophospholipids, at 6 months. B-cell depletion       was accompanied by decreases in B-cell receptor and cytokine signaling but a       pronounced increase in circulating plasma B-cell activating factor (BAFF). This       was followed by an upregulation of a number of signaling and metabolic pathways       at 12 months. Patients with higher baseline brain MRI lesion load demonstrated       both higher levels of cytotoxic and structural proteins in plasma at baseline and       more pronounced biomarker change trajectories over time. Digital cytometry       identified a putative increase in myeloid cells and a pro-inflammatory subset of       T-cells. Therapeutic effects of ocrelizumab extend beyond CD20-mediated B-cell       lysis and implicate metabolic reprogramming, juxtaposing the early normalization       of immune activation, cytokine signaling and metabolite and lipid turnover in       periphery with changes in the dynamics of immune cell activation or composition.       We identify BAFF increase following CD20 depletion as a tentative compensatory       mechanism that contributes to the reconstitution of targeted B-cells,       necessitating further research.

10.1126/science.adr7403	Intercellular communication in the brain through a dendritic nanotubular network.	Chang M, Krüssel S, Parajuli LK, Kim J, Lee D, Merodio A, Kwon J, Okabe S, Kwon HB	Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence       in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic       filopodia forming direct dendrite-dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex.       Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs' actin-rich       composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca(2+)) propagation.       Imaging and machine learning-based analysis validated in situ DNTs as       anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small       molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation       in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1,       presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in       Alzheimer's disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ       propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular       accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the       brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41568-025-00869-w	Unveiling the molecular and immunological drivers of antibody-drug conjugates in       cancer treatment.	Zippelius A, Tolaney SM, Tarantino P, Balthasar JP, Thurber GM	After decades of investment, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are finally       demonstrating their potential, marked by a growing number of clinical approvals,       applications in earlier lines of treatment and integration into drug       combinations, including immunotherapies. This progress has spurred investment in       developing new ADCs and expanding the use of approved ADCs in clinical practice.       The design of ADCs is complex, involving multiple molecular components that       interact with both tumour and host tissue microenvironments. In this Review, we       explore the molecular and immunological factors influencing ADC efficacy and       toxicity. We describe how the molecular components of ADCs determine their       systemic, tissue and cellular distribution, which ultimately dictates therapeutic       efficacy. These interactions also determine the toxicity profile and set       limitations on maximum dosing. Finally, we discuss the impact of ADC treatment on       immune cells, emphasizing the distinct but interconnected roles of immunogenic       cell death, activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells and antibody-Fc       interactions. These mechanisms are crucial for increasing efficacy beyond the       direct cytotoxic effects of the payload. By providing insights into the intricate       interactions of ADCs, this Review aims to inform the rational design of       combination therapies and guide the development of the next generation of       clinically effective ADCs.

10.1126/science.adu4235	Localized glutamine leakage drives the spatial structure of root microbial       colonization.	Tsai HH, Tang Y, Jiang L, Xu X, Dénervaud Tendon V, Pang J, Jia Y, Wippel K, Vacheron J, Keel C, Andersen TG, Geldner N, Zhou F	Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences       the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial       colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that       endodermal Casparian strips-forming the root's extracellular diffusion       barrier-restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and       controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that       vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and       enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate       formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced       attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display       bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid       metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal       nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and       assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.

Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the       most transformative and safe drugs in oncology(1) and autoimmunity(2), are rarely       used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance(3).       Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human       mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and       pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the       KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal       activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were       protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two       geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K.       pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake       by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb       that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to       isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with       antimicrobial resistance.

10.1016/j.neuron.2025.09.004	Astrocyte-mediated central amygdala microcircuit gates comorbid anxiety symptoms       in chronic pain.	Zan GY, Yao SY, Deng YZ, Jiang YH, Ye RF, Chen Y, Long JD, Cheng YJ, Chai JR, Xu C, Zhao M, Liu ZQ, Liu JG, Wang YJ	Comorbid anxiety symptoms are prominent affective components of chronic pain, yet       the central mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain elusive. The central       amygdala (CeA) regulates nociceptive processing and associated anxiety in chronic       pain. However, the specific microcircuits and cell types within the CeA that       regulate pain-related anxiety have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we       discovered a microcircuit in the CeA wherein dynorphinergic neurons of the       lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CeL) project to the medial       subdivision (CeM), activation of which gates anxiogenic effects associated with       chronic pain. Dynorphin-mediated activation of CeM astroglial kappa opioid       receptors (KORs), dependent upon corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor 2       signaling, enhanced CeM neuron excitability by promoting N-methyl-D-aspartate       receptor (NMDAR) activation, likely via releasing gliotransmitter D-serine.       Behaviorally, KOR-mediated bidirectional communication between CeA peptidergic       neurons and astrocytes modulates the anxiogenic effect of chronic pain. Our       findings reveal a neuroglial microcircuit underlying pain-associated anxiety and       suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.	Neuron	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09542-6	Polygenic and developmental profiles of autism differ by age at diagnosis.	Zhang X, Grove J, Gu Y, Buus CK, Nielsen LK, Neufeld SAS, Koko M, Malawsky DS, Wade EM, Verhoef E, Gui A, Hegemann L, Geschwind DH, Wray NR, Havdahl A, Ronald A, St Pourcain B, Robinson EB, Bourgeron T, Baron-Cohen S, Børglum AD, Martin HC, Warrier V	Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges       in early childhood(1,2), many autistic people are diagnosed later in life(3-5).       It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different       developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from       four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional       and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent       cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for       approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the       contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically       explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic       architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically       correlated (r(g) = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these       factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and       communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically       correlated with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health       conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism       diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in       adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and       mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and       later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic       profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize       autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1038/s41577-025-01221-x	Regulators of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion.	Sun Q, Dong C	T cell exhaustion is an adaptive and distinct cell fate that emerges in response       to persistent antigen stimulation, primarily in chronic infections and cancer. It       is characterized by a progressive loss of effector functions and sustained       expression of multiple inhibitory receptors. Progression to T cell exhaustion is       driven by persistent antigen stimulation through the T cell receptor and is       modulated by signals from co-stimulatory and inhibitory molecules as well as by       microenvironmental factors such as cytokines, metabolites and neuronal factors.       These extrinsic cellular factors reshape the T cell transcriptome, epigenome and       metabolism towards a state of exhaustion through critical intrinsic cell       regulators. In this Review, we summarize our current understanding of the       regulators involved in T cell exhaustion, highlighting their roles in directing       the fates and functionalities of distinct exhausted T cell subsets and how they       may be harnessed for the development of improved immunotherapies against cancer       and chronic infections.

Current recipient-centric desensitization protocols involving       antibody depletion through plasmapheresis increase the risk of infections,       perioperative bleeding events and costs. Here we present a donor-centric       desensitization protocol, converting type-A kidneys into enzyme-converted O       kidneys during hypothermic perfusion to remove the A antigen from the kidneys. An       ex vivo model resulted in no antibody-mediated injury. Encouraged by this, an       enzyme-converted O kidney was transplanted into a type-O brain-dead recipient       with a high titre of anti-A antibody, and no hyperacute rejection was observed.       The graft was well tolerated with no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection for       2 days. Antibody-mediated lesions and complement deposition were found starting 3       days post-transplant, coinciding with A-antigen regeneration, and later higher       Banff scores, suggesting an immune-mediated response. Single-cell sequencing       confirms the elevated expression of accommodation-related genes, suggesting the       potential for longer-term tolerance. This study provides a donor-centric organ       engineering strategy and has the potential to broaden the reach of       ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, improving the fairness of and access to       organ allocation.

10.1038/s41586-025-09589-5	Dietary cysteine enhances intestinal stemness via CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-22.	Chi F, Zhang Q, Shay JES, Han S, Ten Hoeve J, Yuan Y, Yang Z, Shin H, Block S, Solanki S, Shah YM, Vander Heiden MG, Agudo J, Yilmaz ÖH	A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter       their cellular composition in response to dietary cues(1-8). The mammalian small       intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs)       that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic       diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and       injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a       semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration       following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in       intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ(+)       T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22       signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The       mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is       demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine       effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the       response, and mice with CD8αβ(+) T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ(+)       T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These       findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8(+) T       cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits       ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.

10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.011	Obesity, diabetes, and inflammation: Pathophysiology and clinical implications.	Donath MY, Drucker DJ	Obesity and its related disorders, including type 2 diabetes and liver, kidney,       and cardiovascular diseases, are now recognized as chronic inflammatory       conditions. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying inflammation in these       settings and how they may contribute to pathology. Nutrient excess triggers       immune activation through pattern recognition receptors and the NLRP3       inflammasome, leading to interleukin (IL)-1β production and downstream cytokine       cascades. Initially adaptive, this inflammation promotes tissue remodeling and       metabolic compensation, but chronic activation contributes to insulin resistance,       β cell dysfunction, and end-organ damage. We discuss the current therapeutic       options, with a focus on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists,       which, alone or combined with additional bioactive moieties, exert notable       anti-inflammatory effects. Some effects of GLP-1 medicines are independent of       glucose control or weight loss, and they are attributed to direct signaling via       the immune GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and, indirectly, via central nervous system       circuits. Understanding these mechanisms may unlock further therapeutic potential       in chronic inflammatory diseases.	Immunity	03/10/2025

Using parallel in-pool profiling of       Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) within a genome-wide knockout       library, we present a comprehensive catalog that assesses the influence of nearly       every human gene on DSB repair outcomes. This REPAIRome resource uncovers       uncharacterized mechanisms, pathways, and factors involved in DSB repair,       including opposing roles for XLF and PAXX, a molecular explanation for       Cas9-induced multinucleotide insertions, HLTF functions in Cas9-induced DSB       repair, the involvement of the SAGA complex in microhomology-mediated end       joining, and an indel mutational signature linked to VHL loss, renal carcinoma,       and hypoxia. These results exemplify the potential of REPAIRome to drive future       discoveries in DSB repair, CRISPR-Cas gene editing and the etiology of cancer       mutational signatures.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.08.033	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Zhang CX, Huang RY, Sheng G, Thiery JP	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental mechanism involved in       the morphogenesis of metazoans. Through this evolutionarily conserved multi-stage       process, cells acquire quasi-epithelial to multiple intermediate morphologies       with epithelial and mesenchymal attributes, rarely reaching a complete       mesenchymal phenotype. Complex evolutionary-conserved morphogenetic movements in       gastrulation are described extensively, as they exemplify the extent of       epithelial cell plasticity in the animal kingdom. Nonetheless, a single-gene       knockout can modify the mode of gastrulation while achieving the same body plan.       Numerous interconnected mechanisms drive different degrees of EMT, including       surface receptor signaling, metabolism, and epigenetics. EMT is reactivated in       adult tissues during repair and disease, particularly in cancer initiation,       progression to metastasis, and refractoriness to treatment. EMT also contributes       to dormancy and drug tolerance, leading to minimal residual disease at the origin       of recurrences. Multiple EMT states coexist in tumors, creating a dynamic       ecosystem for generating an inflammatory microenvironment, stemness, invasion,       and metastasis. This review provides an in-depth description of these aspects       along with recent controversies and offers new opportunities to further explore       the multiple functions of EMT. Examining the potential attributes of EMT in       tissue repair, fibrosis, and cancer progression can provide new opportunities for       therapeutic intervention.	Cell	02/10/2025
10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.007	Notch3 destabilizes regulatory T cells to drive autoimmune neuroinflammation in       multiple sclerosis.	Benamar M, Contini P, Schmitz-Abe K, Lanzetta O, Getachew F, Bachelin C, Leyva Castillo JM, Wang M, Oktelik FB, Perrot O, Batamack Y, Arbag SN, Stephen-Victor E, Harb H, Agrawal PB, Louapre C, Ivaldi F, Uccelli A, Inglese M, Angelini C, Zujovic V, De Palma R, Chatila TA	The immune regulatory defects that promote neuroinflammation in multiple       sclerosis (MS) remain unclear. We show that a specific regulatory T (Treg) cell       subpopulation expressing Notch3 was increased in individuals with MS and in mice       with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Notch3(+) Treg cells were       induced by the gut microbiota via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent mechanisms.       They then translocated to the central nervous system (CNS) in EAE where they       promoted disease severity. Notch3 interacted with delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) on       microglia to subvert Treg cells into T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Notch3 deletion in       Treg cells prevented EAE onset by stabilizing Treg cells and by simultaneously       promoting the expansion of a tissue-resident Treg cell population that expressed       neuropeptide Y receptor 1 (NPY1R) and which suppressed pathogenic IFN-γ(+) and       GM-CSF(+) T cells. Our studies thus identify altered Treg cell population       dynamics as a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune neuroinflammation.	Immunity	02/10/2025
10.1111/os.13380	Relook into the Risk Factors of Proximal Junctional Kyphosis in Early Onset       Scoliosis Patients: Does the Location of Upper Instrumented Vertebra in Relation       to the Sagittal Apex Matter?	Yang B, Xu L, Zhou Q, Qian Z, Wang B, Zhu Z, Qiu Y, Sun X	Growing rods surgery is the mainstay of treatment for early-onset       scoliosis (EOS) while proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is one of the most       commonly reported postoperative complications. We sought to investigate the       impact of the location of upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) in relation to the       sagittal apex on proximal junctional kyphosis in EOS after traditional growing       rods (GRs) treatment. A total of 102 EOS patients who received       traditional growing rods treatment with a follow-up of at least 2 years between       2009 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographic measurements were       performed before and after the index surgery and at the latest follow-up. We       investigated the coronal Cobb angle and spinopelvic parameters of the whole       spine. The location of the UIV, apex, lower instrumented vertebra (LIV),       inflection vertebra (IV), the number and distance of UIV-apex, LIV-apex and       IV-apex were also recorded. Risk factors for PJK were analyzed by logistic       regression analysis. PJK was observed in 21 patients (20.6%) during the       follow-up period. The PJK group showed a younger age at the index surgery (5.9       vs. 7.1 years, P = 0.042), more lengthening procedure times (5.0 vs. 4.0,       P = 0.032), larger preoperative coronal Cobb angle (82.0 vs. 75.6°, P = 0.038),       higher correction rate (51.2% vs. 44.4%, P = 0.047) and larger postoperative       proximal junctional angle (PJA) (13.9 vs. 5.5°, P < 0.001) than the non-PJK       group. The ratio of the number and distance from UIV-apex to IV-apex also       differed significantly between the two groups. The logistic regression revealed       that age at the index surgery ≤ 7 years, the ratio of the number from UIV- apex       to IV- apex ≤ 0.6 and the ratio of the distance from UIV- apex to IV- apex ≤ 0.6       were independent risk factors for postoperative PJK. Besides younger       age, a closer location of UIV relative to the sagittal apex is identified to be       an independent risk factor of postoperative PJK. Selection of UIV at a relatively       farther location away from the sagittal apex might help prevent occurrence of       PJK.	Orthopaedic surgery	01/01/2009
10.1186/s12909-021-02946-8	Familiarity and genetic literacy among medical students in Indonesia.	Swandayani YM, Cayami FK, Winarni TI, Utari A	There is a lack of genetic knowledge among health care professionals       especially in some developing countries such as Indonesia. Based on our       experience, genetic disorders receive less attention in medical education and       professionals. This study aims to determine the familiarity and literacy of       genetics among medical students in Indonesia. A total of 1003 Indonesian       medical (pre-clinical and clinical) students completed the Rapid Estimate of       Adult Literacy in Genetics (REAL-G) questionnaire with a total score of seven for       familiarity and eight for genetic literacy. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to       compare the familiarity and genetic literacy scores between pre-clinical and       clinical students. The average scores of familiarity and genetic       literacy were 5.63 ± 0.96 and 6.37 ± 0.83, respectively. Genetic familiarity was       higher (p = 0.043) among clinical students than pre-clinical students, while       there was no significant difference in genetic literacy (p = 0.362) between       pre-clinical and clinical students. Genetic familiarity does not impact the level       of genetic literacy. However, medical students' genetic literacy is influenced by       demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, university type, genetic learning       experience, university accreditation, and university location. In       general, Indonesian medical students have relatively good familiarity and       literacy in genetics although further study is necessary to accurately measure       the genetic familiarity and literacy in medical students and general public.

10.1126/sciadv.adw7376	The PP2A-B55α phosphatase is a master regulator of mitochondrial degradation and       biogenesis.

Although mitophagy is one of the main pathways       involved in the clearance of damaged or old mitochondria, its coordination with       mitochondrial biogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, by unbiased approaches       including last-generation liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and       transcriptomics, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55α/PPP2R2A as a       Parkin-dependent regulator of mitochondrial number. Upon mitochondrial damage,       PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by       regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult,       ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4       hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master       regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution.       Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial       biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS.       PP2A-B55α targeting rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in a fly model of       Parkinson's disease, thus suggesting potential therapeutic application.	Science advances	03/10/2025

Thus, enhancing energy dissipation through       increased respiration holds significant therapeutic potential for metabolic       disorders. Through a comprehensive analysis of human and murine adipose tissues,       along with a functional screen, we identify mitochondrial carrier homolog 2, a       mitochondrial outer membrane protein, as a pivotal regulator of mitochondrial       metabolism. Intriguingly, its expression in adipose tissue is a strong       determinant of obesity in humans. Adipocyte-specific ablation of mitochondrial       carrier homolog 2 improves mitochondrial function and whole-body energy       expenditure, independent of uncoupling protein 1. Furthermore, mitochondrial       carrier homolog 2 regulates mitochondrial influx of free fatty acids by       modulating the sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 to malonyl-CoA       through direct physical interaction, leading to enhanced energy expenditure in       adipocytes/adipose tissue. Here we show mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 functions       as a negative regulator of energy metabolism in adipocytes and represents a       potential target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

10.1038/s41571-025-01077-z	The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - new clinical challenges, but       more opportunities.	Kung HC, Zheng KW, Zimmerman JW, Zheng L	Patients with advanced-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)       predominantly receive chemotherapy, and despite initial responses in some       patients, most will have disease progression and often dismal outcomes. This lack       of clinical effectiveness partly reflects not only cancer cell-intrinsic factors       but also the presence of a tumour microenvironment (TME) that precludes access of       both systemic therapies and circulating immune cells to the primary tumour, as       well as supporting the growth of PDAC cells. Combined with improved preclinical       models of PDAC, advances in single-cell spatial multi-omics and       machine learning-based models have provided novel methods of untangling the       complexities of the TME. In this Review, we focus on the desmoplastic stroma and       both the intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity of PDAC, with an emphasis       on cancer-associated fibroblasts and their surrounding immune cell niches. We       describe new approaches in converting the immunologically 'cold' PDAC TME into a       'hot' TME by priming T cell activation, overcoming T cell exhaustion and       unravelling myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, we explore       integrated targets involving the TME, such as points of convergence among tumour,       stromal and immune cell metabolism as well as oncogenic KRAS signalling. Finally,       building on our experience with failed clinical trials in the past, we consider       how this evolving comprehensive understanding of the TME will ensure future       success in developing more effective therapies for patients with PDAC.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01625-3	Anti-cytokine biologics for asthma in adults.	Israel E, Wechsler ME, Jackson DJ, Moore WC	An estimated 3-10% of patients with asthma are unable to reach full control with       currently available inhaled therapies. In a large proportion of these patients,       asthma can be driven in whole or in part by type 2 (T2) inflammation, which is       usually initiated by an immunological response to stimulation at mucosal       surfaces. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies, which target T2 inflammatory       processes, provides important options for this population. In the past decade,       five anticytokine biologics (ACBs) that block specific T2 inflammatory cytokines       have been introduced. Three biologics, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab,       inhibit the IL-5 or IL-5 receptor pathway; dupilumab blocks IL-4 and IL-13       through its activity on the IL-4 receptor-alpha; and tezepelumab prevents       activation of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine production cascade. These       drugs reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and patient-reported asthma       quality of life in individuals with a history of asthma exacerbations and       evidence of T2 inflammation. Some also allow oral corticosteroid reduction or       elimination in patients dependent on these therapies for asthma control. The       effect of ACBs varies by the degree of T2 inflammation, which is most easily       assessed by blood eosinophil counts and exhaled nitric oxide. The use of ACBs       guided by these biomarkers and phenotypic characteristics of patients with severe       asthma allows a personalised medicine approach that increases the likelihood of       improvement.

10.1186/s12943-025-02459-8	Reprogramming cellular senescence and aging clocks for advanced cancer       immunotherapy.	Yang H, Liu D, Qiu L, Wang R, Zhang C, Yu D, Zhong Q, Yuki N, Song Z, Zhu T, Ju H, Hong W, Zhu J	Cellular senescence has gradually been recognized as a key process, which not       only inhibits the occurrence of early tumors but also promotes advanced malignant       progression through secretory and immunomodulatory functions. Initially, cellular       senescence manifested as irreversible cell cycle arrest, but now it encompasses a       broader phenotype regulated by the p53-p21CIP1 and p16INK4A-Rb pathways. Although       secretory phenotypes related to aging can recruit immune effectors to clear new       tumor cells, persistent senescent cell populations often trigger chronic       inflammation, promoting immune escape and fibrosis. In this review, we first       discuss the molecular underpinnings of cellular senescence, highlighting its       induction pathways and diverse physiological or pathological roles. We then       examine the composition of the tumor microenvironment, where senescent cells       accumulate and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, reshaping immune surveillance       and extracellular matrix architecture. Against this backdrop, we explore how       aging clocks refine our understanding of individual susceptibility to malignancy       by distinguishing biological from chronological aging. We also present current       therapeutic prospects, including senolytic agents targeting senescent stromal       cells that promote tumor growth, and the utilization of aging clock metrics to       tailor immunotherapies more effectively for older patients. Finally, we consider       the major challenges facing clinical translation, from standardizing multi-omics       data pipelines to clarifying the ethical implications of measuring biological       age. By bridging senescence biology with geroscience and cutting-edge oncology,       we posit that aging clocks may catalyze a transformation in cancer care, enabling       more personalized, effective, and age-conscious treatment strategies.

10.1016/j.immuni.2012.02.019	Disruption of Fnip1 reveals a metabolic checkpoint controlling B lymphocyte       development.	Park H, Staehling K, Tsang M, Appleby MW, Brunkow ME, Margineantu D, Hockenbery DM, Habib T, Liggitt HD, Carlson G, Iritani BM	The coordination of nutrient and energy availability with cell growth and       division is essential for proper immune cell development and function. By using a       chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice, we identified a pedigree that has a       complete block in B cell development at the pre-B cell stage resulting from a       deletion in the Fnip1 gene. Enforced expression of an immunoglobulin transgene       failed to rescue B cell development. Whereas essential pre-B cell signaling       molecules were activated normally in Fnip1-null pre-B cells, the metabolic       regulators AMPK and mTOR were dysregulated, resulting in excessive cell growth       and enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis in response to metabolic stress (pre-B cell       receptor crosslinking, oncogene activation). These results indicate that       Folliculin-interacting protein 1 (Fnip1) is vital for B cell development and       metabolic homeostasis and reveal a metabolic checkpoint that may ensure that       pre-B cells have sufficient metabolic capacity to support division, while       limiting lymphomagenesis caused by deregulated growth.

If step changes are to be made in the management of       knee osteoarthritis, novel patient stratification approaches are needed to       identify the most effective treatment for individual patients. Numerous methods       for stratifying patients with knee osteoarthritis can be employed; clinical       presentation, including co-morbidity and pain phenotype, can influence treatment       decisions, and there is a rich history of imaging biomarker use, both from       conventional radiographs and, since its development, via MRI, in identifying       patients at risk of disease progression, and the latter facilitates the detection       of synovitis. The development of novel biochemical biomarkers and the rapid       growth of '-omics' technologies provide fresh opportunities to deploy these       advances in the stratification of patients with knee osteoarthritis. The health       economic landscape in this area is developing, and scoping work has highlighted       the need for further studies.	Nature reviews. Rheumatology	03/10/2025

Here we show that glioblastoma,       the most malignant type of brain tumor, induces calvarial bone abnormalities in       murine models and patients with glioblastoma, altering osteoclast activities and       increasing the number of skull channels in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing       revealed glioblastoma-mediated alterations in the immune landscape of skull       marrow and femoral bone marrow, including expansion of neutrophils and       deterioration of various B cell subsets. In vivo inhibition of bone resorption       reduced bone abnormalities, but promoted tumor progression in mesenchymal subtype       tumors. This also abolished the survival benefit of the checkpoint inhibitor       anti-PD-L1, by reducing activated T cell and increasing inflammatory neutrophil       numbers. Together, these data provide insight into how brain tumors affect skull       bone and the immune environment.	Nature neuroscience	03/10/2025
10.1136/gutjnl-2025-334988	DPP-4 inhibitor alleviates gut-brain axis pathology in Parkinson's disease.	Jeong SH, Kim YJ, Shin JY, Oh KW, Lee JW, Lee PH	Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have been reported to       exhibit therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing their       potential for drug repurposing. One aspect of PD pathogenesis is thought to be       associated with the gut-brain axis, where α-synuclein from the gut is transmitted       to the brain via the vagus nerve (VN). We explored whether       sitagliptin, a DPP-4i, exhibits a protective effect in a low-dose       rotenone-treated gut-brain axis-associated PD model. To explore the       effect of sitagliptin, we used the oral rotenone-treated mouse model, which       showed spreading of pathological α-synuclein from the intestine in a stereotypic       manner via the VN into the midbrain with motor deficits. Sitagliptin       mitigated rotenone-induced gut inflammation and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)       expression, reduced α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, VN and brain and       lessened neuronal loss in the medulla and midbrain with recovery of motor       performance. In addition, sitagliptin suppressed inflammation in response to a       TLR2 agonist and rotenone in macrophages, enteric glial cells and enteroendocrine       cell lines in vitro. In secretin tumour cell 1, an enteroendocrine cell line,       sitagliptin also decreased rotenone-induced endogenous α-synuclein levels. The       beneficial effects of sitagliptin were maintained even under glucagon-like       peptide-1 receptor blockade. Notably, sitagliptin significantly altered the gut       microbiome, shifting towards a profile that may counteract PD pathology.       These findings demonstrated that sitagliptin alleviated α-synuclein       deposition in the gut and brain through modulation of TLR2-mediated inflammation       and altered the gut microbiome composition towards a more favourable profile,       which indicates that DPP-4is can offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing       PD.

10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.004	Eomesodermin(+) CD4(+) T cells are critical for curative immunotherapy outcomes.

However, specific Eomesodermin (Eomes)-dependent stages of Tr1 differentiation       and function remain unclear. Using preclinical models of bone marrow       transplantation (BMT), we demonstrated a Tr1 differentiation trajectory in vivo       from Eomes(+)IL-10(-) to Eomes(+)IL-10(+) subsets with the acquisition of       cytokine, cytolytic, and exhaustion features. The Eomes(+)CD4(+) fraction       represented the dominant cytotoxic subset after BMT, mediating       graft-versus-leukemia effects while limiting inflammation. In CD19-targeted       chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, Eomes drove the same CD4(+)       Tr1 phenotype that controlled cytolysis, while mitigating immune toxicity and       promoting persistence. In individuals with high-grade B cell lymphomas that had       long-term disease control after receiving commercial CD19-targeted CAR T cells,       Eomes(+) Tr1 cells represented a stable population comprising 40%-80% of the       CD4(+) CAR T cell population. Hence, Eomes controls both regulatory and cytotoxic       programs in CD4(+) T cells, essential for curative immunotherapy outcomes.	Immunity	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41564-025-02114-4	A generative artificial intelligence approach for the discovery of antimicrobial       peptides against multidrug-resistant bacteria.	Wang Y, Zhao L, Li Z, Xi Y, Pan Y, Zhao G, Zhang L	The discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against clinical superbugs       is urgently needed to address the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis. AMPs are       promising candidates due to their broad-spectrum activity, rapid bactericidal       mechanisms and reduced likelihood of inducing resistance compared with       conventional antibiotics. Here, a pre-trained protein large language model (LLM),       ProteoGPT, was established and further developed into multiple specialized       subLLMs to assemble a sequential pipeline. This pipeline enables rapid screening       across hundreds of millions of peptide sequences, ensuring potent antimicrobial       activity and minimizing cytotoxic risks. Through transfer learning, we endowed       the LLMs with different domain-specific knowledge to achieve high-throughput       mining and generation of AMPs within a unified methodological framework. Notably,       both mined and generated AMPs exhibited reduced susceptibility to resistance       development in ICU-derived carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB)       and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. The AMPs also       showed comparable or superior therapeutic efficacy in in vivo thigh infection       mouse models compared with clinical antibiotics, without causing organ damage and       disrupting gut microbiota. The mechanisms of action of these AMPs involve       disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and membrane depolarization. Overall, this       study presents a generative artificial intelligence approach for the discovery of       novel antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant bacteria, enabling efficient and       extensive exploration of AMP space.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105941	Poor sleep health is associated with older brain age: the role of systemic       inflammation.	Miao Y, Wang J, Li X, Guo J, Ekblom MM, Sindi S, Zhang Q, Dove A	Poor-quality sleep has been linked to increased dementia risk. We       investigated the relationship between healthy sleep pattern and older brain age,       and the extent to which this is mediated by systemic inflammation. The       study included 27,500 adults from the UK Biobank (mean age 54.7 y, 54.0% female).       The presence of five self-reported healthy sleep characteristics (early       chronotype, 7-8 h daily sleep, no insomnia, no snoring, no excessive daytime       sleepiness) were summed into a healthy sleep score (0-5 pts) and used to define       three sleep patterns: healthy (≥4 pts), intermediate (2-3 pts), and poor (≤1 pt).       Low-grade inflammation was estimated using the INFLA-score, a composite index of       inflammatory biomarkers. After a mean follow-up of 8.9 y, brain age was estimated       using a machine learning model based on 1079 brain MRI phenotypes and used to       calculate brain age gap (BAG; i.e., brain age minus chronological age). Data were       analysed using linear regression and generalised structural equation models.       At baseline, 898 (3.3%) participants had poor sleep, 15,283 (55.6%) had       intermediate sleep, and 11,319 (41.2%) had healthy sleep. Compared to healthy       sleep, intermediate (β = 0.25 [0.11, 0.40], P = 0.010) and poor (β = 0.46 [0.05,       0.87], P < 0.001) sleep were associated with significantly higher BAG. In       mediation analysis, INFLA-score mediated 6.81% and 10.42% of the associations       between intermediate and poor sleep and higher BAG. Poor sleep       health may accelerate brain ageing. This may be driven by higher levels of       systemic inflammation.

Squizzato F, D'Oria M, Antonello M, Trimarchi S, Mani K, Holden A, Kölbel T, Haulon S, Verhoeven E, Böckler D, Resch T, Azizzadeh A, Lombardi J, Piazza M	The aim of this study was to achieve an international expert consensus       on managing acute type B penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs) and intramural       haematomas (IMHs). A modified Delphi consensus process was employed to       develop recommendations for the management of acute type B PAU and IMH. Surveys       were sent to international experts practicing in high volume aortic centres       worldwide. Statements were voted on using a four point Likert scale in a three       round Delphi process. Statements achieving grade A (full agreement 75%) or B       (overall agreement 80%, full disagreement < 5%) were included as expert       recommendations. Consistency of responses was measured using Cohen's κ and the       intraclass correlation coefficient. Eighty three experts were included       in the final analysis: 25 statements achieved a consensus, 18 (72%) receiving a       grade B strength and 7 (28%) a grade A strength. Most statements (97%) had a high       consistency classified as grade I or II. The expert panel agreed on the       indication for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for complicated       IMH/PAU, defined by rupture or refractory pain/hypertension. Uncomplicated       IMH/PAU should be managed conservatively and followed up with serial computed       tomography imaging during the acute phase. High risk uncomplicated IMHs are       identified by increased haematoma thickness, new onset or increased size of ulcer       like projections, or transition to aortic dissection; high risk uncomplicated       PAUs are defined by new associated haematoma, PAU width/depth increase, or total       aortic diameter increase. Uncomplicated high risk IMH/PAUs may be considered for       TEVAR. In performing TEVAR, a proximal sealing length > 20 mm in a site free from       haematoma should be achieved, eventually extending in zone 2, with a 0 - 10%       oversize. Patency of the left subclavian artery should be maintained. An agreement among international experts was achieved on assessment, management,       and follow up of acute type B IMHs and PAUs, addressing areas of inconsistencies       or knowledge gaps in existing guidelines.

10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00399-7	Genetic modification of the AJCC classification of papillary thyroid cancer: an       international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study.	Xing M, Lin S, Mathur A, Li Y, Bendlova B, Kuklikova V, Melo M, Jesus TT, Soares P, Colombo C, Fugazzola L, Mitsutake N, Matsuse M, Sako A, Estrada-Florez AP, Carvajal-Carmona LG, Bohórquez ME, Mian C, Vianello F, O'Neill CJ, Clifton-Bligh R, Czarniecka A, Jarzab B, Jung CK, Brahma B, Ladenson PW, Park YJ	The four-stage American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging       system has been used for almost 50 years for assessing the risk of multiple       cancers; the AJCC classification for papillary thyroid cancer is solely based on       clinical parameters, and despite updated editions its accuracy remains       suboptimal. We aimed to evaluate whether the performance of the AJCC system could       be improved by integrating tumour genetic statuses of BRAF and TERT genes.       This retrospective multicentre cohort study used patient medical records       from 15 medical centres across ten countries for patients (of all ages) with       papillary thyroid cancer who had been surgically treated with total thyroidectomy       or hemithyroidectomy with or without neck dissection, followed by postoperative       radioiodine ablation and appropriate thyroid-stimulating hormone level targeting.       Testing for BRAF(V600E) and TERT promotor (TERTp) mutations was performed on       genomic DNA isolated from surgical or cytological specimens of primary papillary       thyroid cancer tumours at each centre. Data from all medical centres were pooled       for aggregated analyses of the relationship between the genetic status and       papillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality for each of the four classical stages       of the 7th and 8th editions of the AJCC system (AJCC7E and AJCC8E). The primary       endpoint was papillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality, characterised by       mortality rates per 1000 person-years. Using patients who were treated       for papillary thyroid cancer between January 1979, to July 2023 at the 15       centres, our cohort comprised of 4746 patients (3612 [76·1%] females and 1134       [23·9%] males), with median age of 48 years (IQR 37-59; 89 [1·9%] patients aged       ≤18 years). For the 4400 patients with available ethnicity data, the majority       were Asian (2140 [48·6%]) and 2096 (47·6%) were White. For AJCC7E, compared with       the original stages, the genetic duet of BRAF(V600E) and TERTp mutations was       associated with increased mortality in all stages versus the corresponding       original stages, although the HR for stage I did not reach statistical       significance. Those with wildtype BRAF(V600E) and TERTp had flat survival curves       for stages I-III with AJCC7E and stages I-II of AJCC8E. Patients with dual       mutations had reductions in survival across all stages for the AJCC7E (stage I HR       5·96 [95% CI 0·73-48·66]; p=0·10; stage II 5·94 [95% CI 1·42-24·91]; p=0·015;       stage III 4·04 [95% CI 1·87-8·70]; p=0·00037; and stage IV 1·79 [95% CI       1·15-2·76]; p=0·0092). TERTp mutation alone was also significantly associated       with a significant increase in mortality for stage IV (3·57 [2·01-6·37];       p<0·0001). For AJCC8E, we observed a similar pattern of increased mortality when       both mutations were present compared to mortality in the original staging, with       significant differences in HR for stages I and II (stage I adjusted HR 10·30 [95%       CI 3·43-30·93], p<0·0001; stage II HR 3·95 [95% CI 1·92-8·15]; p=0·00020). Stage       III also showed increased mortality with dual mutations, but the increase was not       statistically significant (HR 1·77 [0·95-3·31]; p=0·072). In contrast to AJCC7E,       the dual mutations did not increase mortality compared with the original stage IV       (HR 0·95 [0·47-1·92], p=0·89), but the TERTp mutation did significantly increase       mortality in stage IV papillary thyroid cancer (HR 2·75 [1·36-5·58], p=0·0049).       Integrating the genetic statuses of BRAF and TERTp into the AJCC       system changes the original risk stages of the AJCC system and significantly       improves the accuracy of its mortality risk classification for papillary thyroid       cancer.

10.1186/s12933-025-02932-0	Association between metabolic score for insulin resistance and future stroke risk       in patients with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stages 0-3: a       longitudinal analysis based on CHARLS.	Wu H, Zhou Y, Lai X, Ma B, Ding L, Zhu X, Chen Z, Liu Z	Metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney       diseases are closely interrelated, and the proposal of       cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome concept has received extensive       attention.The disease burden of CKM is heavy, with stroke being a significant       contributor, and CKM staging is bidirectional.A large body of evidence has       demonstrated that insulin resistance is closely associated with diseases such as       stroke, obesity and chronic kidney disease. While the metabolic score for insulin       resistance (METS-IR) serves as an important indicator for evaluating insulin       resistance, the relationship between METS-IR and stroke incidence remains unclear       in the population defined by CKM syndrome stages 0-3. In this study,       data on individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3 without stroke at baseline were       collected from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study       (CHARLS).Self-reported stroke was used as the primary outcome, with METS-IR at       baseline as the exposure factor. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the       effect of METS-IR on the incidence of stroke among participants with CKM, and       restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression was utilized to explore the potential       nonlinear relationship between them. To evaluate the predictive value of METS-IR       for stroke risk in individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, we applied receiver       operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A total of 5009 participants       were included in this study, with a mean age of 60.48 ± 8.81 years. Over a 5-year       follow-up, 339 participants in this study developed incident stroke. Participants       were stratified into METS-IR quartiles (Q1-Q4). In the fully adjusted model,       compared with Q1 (the lowest quartile), the odds ratio (OR) for Q3 was 1.88 (95%       1.25-2.81; P = 0.002), and the OR for Q4 was 1.72 (95% 1.08-2.76;       P = 0.02). RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between METS-IR and       stroke risk among participants with CKM syndrome stages 0-3 (P-overall < 0.05;       P-nonlinearity < 0.05). ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of       0.726 (95% 0.699-0.752), with an optimal METS-IR cutoff value of 29.58.       In individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, elevated METS-IR levels       may be associated with an increased stroke risk. Furthermore, METS-IR       demonstrates moderate predictive value for stroke risk in this population.       Monitoring METS-IR may therefore aid in their early identification.

10.1186/s12916-025-04365-8	Changes in accelerated aging and risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality:       three cohort studies.	Zhang JJ, Yu HC, Geng TT, Chen SH, Wang YX, Guo H, Zhang XM, He MA, Gao JL, Liu G, Liao YF, Wu SL, Pan A	Accelerated aging is a dynamic process, yet few studies examined the       association of changes in accelerated aging with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and       mortality. This study aims to evaluate this association in three prospective       cohorts from China and the UK. Data were drawn from the Kailuan cohort       (n = 107,830), the Dongfeng-Tongji (DFTJ) cohort (n = 14,032), and the UK Biobank       (n = 316,087). Accelerated aging was assessed by PhenoAge and Klemera-Doubal       method (KDM) age, measured at baseline (Kailuan cohort: 2006-2009; DFTJ cohort:       2008-2010; UK Biobank: 2006-2010) and the first follow-up (Kailuan cohort:       2010-2013; DFTJ cohort: 2013; UK Biobank: 2012-2013). Changes in accelerated       aging were classified as persistent accelerated aging, recovery from accelerated       aging, delayed accelerated aging, and stable non-accelerated aging. Cox       proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%       confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis was performed to summarize estimates       across three cohorts. Median follow-up periods were 10.3-15.9 years       across three cohorts. When defining accelerated aging by PhenoAge, baseline       accelerated aging was significantly associated with increased risks of CVD       (pooled 1.41, 95% 1.25, 1.60) and mortality (pooled 1.47, 95% 1.33, 1.63). Compared to participants with persistent accelerated aging,       participants recovering from accelerated aging (pooled HR of 0.76, 95% 0.72, 0.81; pooled HR of mortality: 0.84, 95% 0.78, 0.89), delaying       accelerated aging (pooled HR of 0.75, 95% 0.70, 0.79; pooled HR of       mortality: 0.77, 95% 0.72, 0.83) or maintaining non-accelerated aging (pooled       HR of 0.59, 95% 0.48, 0.71; pooled HR of mortality: 0.58, 95% 0.55,       0.62) exhibited decreased risks of both CVD and mortality. When defining       accelerated aging by KDM age, the results remained consistent with those of       PhenoAge. Accelerated aging is a significant risk factor for CVD and       mortality. Recovering from or delaying accelerated aging, or maintaining       non-accelerated aging, was associated with reduced risks of CVD and mortality.	BMC medicine	03/10/2025

Zhu H, Qin X, Wei L, Jiang D, Zhang Q, Wang W, Liang R, Zhang R, Zhang K, Liu G, Zhao KT, Chen K, Qiu JL, Gao C	Directed evolution can rapidly generate genetic variants with new and enhanced       properties, yet efficient platforms for performing such evolution directly in       plant cells have been lacking. We developed Geminivirus Replicon-Assisted in       Planta Directed Evolution (GRAPE), a system that links gene function to       geminivirus rolling circle replication (RCR) to enable high-throughput selection       for desired activities. GRAPE supports the screening of up to 10(5) variants on a       single Nicotiana benthamiana leaf within four days. Using GRAPE, we evolved the       immune receptor NRC3 to resist inhibition by the nematode effector SPRYSEC15 and       broadened the recognition spectrum of the rice immune receptor Pikm-1 to       recognize all six alleles of the fungal effector AVR-Pik. GRAPE provides a rapid,       scalable, and generalizable platform for directed evolution of diverse genes in       plant cellular context.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025
10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01039-6	Effect of repurposed simvastatin on disability progression in secondary       progressive multiple sclerosis (MS-STAT2): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind,       placebo-controlled trial.	Chataway J, Williams T, Blackstone J, John N, Braisher M, De Angelis F, Bianchi A, Calvi A, Doshi A, Apap Mangion S, Wade C, Bordea E, Merry R, Barton G, Lyle D, Jarman E, Mahad D, Shehu A, Arun T, McDonnell G, Geraldes R, Craner M, Hillier C, Ganesalingam J, Fisniku L, Hobart J, Spilker C, Robertson NP, Kalra S, Pluchino S, Harikrishnan S, Mattoscio M, Harrower T, Young C, Lee M, Chhetri SK, Ahmed F, Rog D, Silber E, Gallagher P, Duddy M, Straukiene A, Nicholas R, Rice C, Tebbs S, Hawton A, Hunter R, Giovannoni G, Ciccarelli O, Beveridge J, Nixon S, Thompson AJ, Greenwood J, Pearson OR, Evangelou N, Sharrack B, Galea I, Gray E, Pavitt S, Chandran S, Ford HL, Frost C, Nicholas JM	Despite the success of immune modulation in the treatment of       relapsing multiple sclerosis, disability progression is a major problem driven by       multiple mechanisms. Comorbidities (eg, vascular risk) and ageing are thought to       augment these neurodegenerative pathologies. In the phase 2b MS-STAT trial of       simvastatin (80 mg) versus placebo in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis       (SPMS), the adjusted difference in brain atrophy rate between groups was -0·254%       per year: a 43% reduction. In this phase 3 MS-STAT2 trial, we aimed to assess the       efficacy of simvastatin versus placebo in slowing the progression of disability       in SPMS. This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel group,       placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at 31 neuroscience centres and       district general hospitals in the UK. Participants aged 18-65 years with a       diagnosis of SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of between 4·0       and 6·5 were eligible and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral simvastatin (80 mg) or       matched placebo for up to 4·5 years, based on a minimisation algorithm within an       independent and secure online randomisation service. All participants, site       investigators, and the trial coordinating team were masked to treatment       allocation. The primary outcome was time to 6-month EDSS confirmed disability       progression (an increase of at least 1 point if EDSS score at baseline visit was       less than 6·0 or an increase of 0·5 point if EDSS score at baseline visit was 6·0       or more) assessed in all randomly assigned participants (intention-to-treat       analysis) without imputation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov       (NCT03387670) and is on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN82598726). The study is       completed. Between May 10, 2018, and July 26, 2024, 1079 patients were       screened for eligibility and 964 participants were randomly assigned, with 482       (50%) in the placebo group and 482 (50%) in the simvastatin group. Of all 964       participants, 704 (73%) were female and 260 (27%) were male, with a mean age of       54 years (SD 7). 173 (36%) of 482 participants in the placebo group and 192 (40%)       of 482 participants in the simvastatin group had 6-month confirmed disability       progression (adjusted hazard ratio 1·13 [95% CI 0·91 to 1·39], p=0·26). Although       no emergent safety issues were seen, there was one serious adverse reaction       (rhabdomyolysis) in the simvastatin group. 12 (2%) of 482 participants in the       placebo group and five (1%) of 482 participants in the simvastatin group had a       cardiovascular serious adverse event. The MS-STAT2 trial did not       show a treatment effect of simvastatin in slowing disability progression in SPMS.       Simvastatin use in multiple sclerosis should be confined to existing vascular       indications.

To address ploidy       reduction, we investigated an experimental reductive cell division process,       termed mitomeiosis, wherein non-replicated (2n2c) somatic genomes are prematurely       forced to divide following transplantation into the metaphase cytoplasm of       enucleated human oocytes. However, despite fertilization with sperm, SCNT oocytes       remained arrested at the metaphase stage, indicating activation failure.       Artificial activation using a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor       successfully bypassed this arrest, inducing the segregation of somatic       chromosomes into a zygotic pronucleus and a polar body. Comprehensive chromosome       tracing via sequencing revealed that homologous chromosome segregation occurred       randomly and without crossover recombination. Nonetheless, an average of 23       somatic chromosomes were retained within the zygote, demonstrating the       feasibility of experimentally halving the diploid chromosome set. Fertilized       human SCNT oocytes progressed through normal embryonic cell divisions, ultimately       developing into embryos with integrated somatic and sperm-derived chromosomes.       While our study demonstrates the potential of mitomeiosis for in vitro       gametogenesis, at this stage it remains just a proof of concept and further       research is required to ensure efficacy and safety before future clinical       applications.

10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00429-2	Long-term overall survival with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade and       biomarker-based subgroup analyses in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung       cancer: a systematic review and reconstructed individual patient data       meta-analysis.	Di Federico A, Stumpo S, Mantuano F, De Giglio A, Lo Bianco F, Pecci F, Alessi JV, Wang X, Sperandi F, Melotti B, Gelsomino F, Skoulidis F, Garassino MC, Peters S, Awad MM, Ardizzoni A, Ricciuti B	Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 or PD-1 as monotherapy       or combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors or chemotherapy (or both) are the standard of       care for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it       remains unclear which patients benefit from the addition of CTLA-4 inhibitors. We       aimed to evaluate whether dual checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1       inhibitors provides similar efficacy to PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, or       whether these strategies produce distinct outcomes across NSCLC subpopulations.       We conducted a search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised       phase 3 trials published from database inception to Nov 21, 2024, that       investigated PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors, with or without CTLA-4 inhibitors, in       patients with advanced NSCLC. We focused on studies reporting Kaplan-Meier       survival data at 5 years or biomarker analyses based on PD-L1, KRAS, and STK11       mutational status. Individual patient data were extracted from Kaplan-Meier       curves with WebPlotDigitizer version 5 and reconstructed with the IPDfromKM       method. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival in the       overall population and in subpopulations based on PD-L1 tumour proportion score       (TPS), tumour histology, and mutational status (mutant vs wild-type) of KRAS and       STK11. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251081707. The       initial search yielded 1026 results, and six randomised clinical trials met the       eligibility criteria and were included. Among the 2881 patients eligible for       analysis (838 [29·1%] female and 2043 [70·9%] male), 1282 received dual CTLA-4       and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade and 1599 received single PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade.       Patients treated with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade had similar median       overall survival compared with those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition       (16·1 months [95% CI 15·0-17·8] vs 16·9 months [15·5-18·3]; HR 0·95 [95% CI       0·87-1·03], p=0·19). Median overall survival was significantly longer with dual       CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade among patients with PD-L1 TPS less than 1%       versus those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (15·5 months [95% CI       13·6-18·5] vs 14·5 months [13·4-15·9]; HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·74-0·98], p=0·021), with       5-year overall survival rates of 16·6% (95% CI 13·4-20·6) versus 9·3% (7·0-12·3),       respectively. Median overall survival in patients with tumours harbouring STK11       mutations was also significantly longer with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1       blockade compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (13·9 months [95% CI       9·8-20·8] vs 7·8 months [6·4-12·9]; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·49-0·91], p=0·012).       However, no significant differences in overall survival were found between       treatment groups by tumour histology (squamous vs non-squamous NSCLC) or by KRAS       mutational status. Compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition,       dual immune checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors was       associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC and       PD-L1 TPS less than 1% and in those with STK11 mutations, but not in the overall       population. Prospective validation of these results in clinical trials is       warranted. NextGenerationUE.	The Lancet. Oncology	29/09/2025

This randomized phase 1b trial       (NCT05890742) evaluated a neoadjuvant regimen of IBI310 (anti-cytotoxic T       lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4]) plus sintilimab (n = 52) versus       sintilimab monotherapy (n = 49). Surgery was performed in 51 and 45 patients,       respectively. The primary endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR) rate,       was significantly higher in the combination compared to the monotherapy arm       within the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (78.4% versus 46.7%, p =       0.0015), with consistent results in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (76.9%       versus 42.9%). Safety in both arms was comparable and manageable without new       safety signals. After a median follow-up of 21.4 months, no disease recurrences       occurred. One death occurred in each arm due to postoperative complication and       adverse events. These findings demonstrate the added benefit of neoadjuvant       IBI310 plus sintilimab over sintilimab monotherapy for locally advanced       MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer.	Cancer cell	02/10/2025
10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00287-5	Dupilumab versus omalizumab in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal       polyps and coexisting asthma (EVEREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind,       head-to-head phase 4 trial.	De Corso E, Canonica GW, Heffler E, Springer M, Grzegorzek T, Viana M, Horváth Z, Mullol J, Gevaert P, Michel J, Peters AT, Wagenmann M, Zaghloul S, Zhang M, Corbett M, Nash S, Angello JT, Radwan A, Deniz Y, Martin A, Hellings PW	Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is predominantly       driven by type 2 inflammation. The biologics dupilumab and omalizumab, which       target drivers and mediators of type 2 inflammation (interleukin [IL]-4/IL-13       signaling and immunoglobulin E [IgE], respectively), are efficacious in treating       CRSwNP but direct comparisons are few. In EVEREST (EValuating trEatment RESponses       of dupilumab versus omalizumab), the first head-to-head trial in respiratory       biologics, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of dupilumab and       omalizumab in patients with severe CRSwNP who had mild, moderate, or severe       asthma. EVEREST was an international, randomised, double-blind, phase 4       trial, conducted at 100 hospitals or clinical centres in 17 countries. Sites were       selected with otolaryngology, pneumologist, allergist, and immunologist       practices; needed to have previously conducted double-blind studies; and were       required have nasal endoscopy and electrocardiogram machines. Eligible patients       aged 18 years or older with severe uncontrolled CRSwNP (with a nasal polyp score       of 5 or more [and ≥2 for each nostril]), symptoms of nasal congestion and loss of       smell for at least 8 weeks before screening, and physician-diagnosed asthma.       Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2       weeks or omalizumab weight-tiered and IgE-tiered dosing every 2 weeks or 4 weeks       for 24 weeks, with background mometasone furoate nasal spray. Patients and       investigators were masked to the study drugs. Primary endpoints were change from       baseline in endoscopic nasal polyp score and University of Pennsylvania Smell       Identification Test (UPSIT) at 24 weeks. Efficacy was assessed in the       intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at       least one dose of study medication. The trial was registered at       ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04998604. Between Sept 27, 2021, and Dec 27,       2024, 819 individuals were screened for study inclusion, 459 were excluded (most       common screen failures were: 167 did not meet nasal polyp score ≥5 or did not       have ongoing symptoms of nasal congestion and loss of smell, 114 did not meet       pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) ≤85% predicted normal, and 99 did not meet eligibility       as per omalizumab drug-dosing), and 360 participants were randomly assigned (181       assigned to the dupilumab group and 179 assigned to the omalizumab group). Of the       360 participants, 198 (55%) participants were male, 162 (45%) were female, and       the mean age of the total population sample was 52 years (SD 13·1). Improvements       were significantly greater with dupilumab than omalizumab for all primary and       secondary efficacy endpoints at week 24. Least squares mean differences in change       from baseline dupilumab over omalizumab were: nasal polyp score -1·60 (95% CI       -1·96 to -1·25; p<0·0001) and UPSIT 8·0 (6·3 to 9·7; p<0·0001). 115 (64%) of 179       participants in the dupilumab group and 116 (67%) of 173 participants in the       omalizumab group reported treatment-emergent adverse events, the most common of       which were nasopharyngitis, accidental overdose, headache, upper respiratory       tract infection, and cough. There were no deaths in the study. Dupilumab was superior to omalizumab in patients with severe CRSwNP and       coexisting asthma. These findings support the efficacy of dupilumab in patients       with type 2 respiratory diseases versus an active biologic comparator, the known       safety profiles of dupilumab and omalizumab, and could enable better treatment       targeting for patients with CRSwNP and asthma in clinical practice.

10.3171/2025.5.JNS25786	Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and       intracerebral hemorrhage: a propensity-matched multi-institutional cohort study.	Costa M, O'Leary S, Price AM, Young CC, Srinivasan VM, Kan P	The authors evaluated whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor       agonists (GLP-1-RAs) improve outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid       hemorrhage (aSAH), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and acute       ischemic stroke (AIS) and reduce the overall incidence of these events. This retrospective study leveraged TriNetX data (2014-2024) to identify patients       with aSAH, sICH, or AIS. Individuals receiving exenatide, lixisenatide,       semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or tirzepatide within 8 weeks of diagnosis       were propensity matched to controls. Outcomes (e.g., mortality,       rebleeding/recurrence, seizures, hydrocephalus) were assessed at 6 and 12 months;       the incidence rates of stroke types were examined at 1 and 2 years. For       aSAH patients, GLP-1-RA use at 6 months reduced rebleeding (OR 0.73, p = 0.003)       and mortality (OR 0.41, p < 0.001) and at 1 year lowered cognitive deficits (OR       0.63, p = 0.034) and mortality (OR 0.39, p < 0.001). In sICH patients, GLP-1-RAs       decreased hydrocephalus (OR 0.37, p = 0.005) and seizures (OR 0.56, p = 0.007) at       6 months, with persistent benefits at 1 year (hydrocephalus, OR 0.38, p = 0.007;       seizures, OR 0.63, p = 0.018), alongside lower mortality (OR 0.45-0.40, both p <       0.001) and rebleeding (OR 0.70-0.69, both p < 0.001) rates. In AIS patients,       mortality fell at 6 months (OR 0.27, p < 0.001) and 1 year (OR 0.44, p < 0.001),       with reduced recurrence (OR 0.60, p < 0.001) and lower hydrocephalus (OR 0.32, p       < 0.001) and seizure (OR 0.43, p < 0.001) rates at 6 months. At 1 year, GLP-1-RA       users had lower incidence rates of SAH (OR 0.64, p = 0.001), ICH (OR 0.62, p <       0.001), and AIS (OR 0.82, p = 0.003), which were sustained at 2 years (ORs       0.77-0.87, all p < 0.05). Adverse events were similar. GLP-1-RAs       were associated with improved survival and fewer complications across stroke       subtypes, plus reduced hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke incidence. Prospective       trials are warranted to confirm these observations.	Journal of neurosurgery	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.anai.2025.09.014	Basic Mechanisms of Itch and Advances in Clinical Management.	Coscarella G, Edwards E, Yosipovitch G	Chronic pruritus requires comprehensive assessment and management due to its       profound impact on quality of life. The etiologies of pruritus are diverse,       encompassing dermatologic, neuropathic, systemic, psychogenic, and mixed causes.       Pruritogens activate C and Aδ fibers through histaminergic and non-histaminergic       pathways. Increasing evidence highlights the role of Th2 cytokines, particularly       interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-31, which directly stimulate sensory neurons       and perpetuate the itch-scratch cycle. Itch perception arises from dynamic       interactions between the immune system and the peripheral and central nervous       systems. Signals transmitted by sensory fibers are processed in the dorsal horn       and relayed to thalamic and cortical centers, reinforcing chronicity. Diagnostic       evaluation begins with detailed history and examination, complemented by       laboratory testing such as complete blood count, kidney, liver, glucose, and       thyroid function tests to uncover systemic or neurologic contributors. For       dermatologic conditions, topical immunomodulators-including corticosteroids,       calcineurin inhibitors, and PDE4 inhibitors- are first-line options for localized       itch. Extensive itch may require systemic immunosuppressants or phototherapy.       Biologic agents targeting IL-4/IL-13 and IL-31 pathways have revolutionized       treatment for atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis, while JAK-STAT inhibitors       also offer significant antipruritic effect in atopic dermatitis and beyond.       Neuropathic itch may respond to topical anesthetics: menthol, pramoxine,       capsaicin, or compounded ketamine-amitriptyline-lidocaine formulations, as well       as systemic gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Systemic or intractable pruritus       may benefit from kappa opioid receptor agonists. New drugs targeting the mast       cell such as BTK inhibitors, c-KIT inhibitors, and MRGPRX2 antagonists have       robust anti-pruritic effects in mast cell-mediated diseases. Supportive measures,       including psychosocial interventions, remain integral to long-term management.	Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American	02/10/2025
10.1186/s12974-025-03546-9	Microglial glycolytic reprogramming in alzheimer's disease: association with       impaired phagocytic function and altered vascular proximity.	Lu N, Jin Z, Liu N, Zhu C, Wei H, Xu Q	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by chronic       neuroinflammation alongside amyloid-beta plaque and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau)       tangle accumulation. Microglia, as resident immune cells, undergo glycolytic       reprogramming that may exacerbate inflammation and impede toxic protein       clearance. Specifically, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) drives       proinflammatory microglial phenotypes linked to neurodegeneration. This study       investigates how PKM2-mediated microglial glycolytic reprogramming and       inflammatory responses alongside Aβ/p-Tau clearance in human AD brains. Hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HP-EC) tissues from 8 AD patients and       8 matched controls underwent multiplex immunohistochemistry and high-resolution       spatial analysis. PKM2(+)Iba1(+) microglia density significantly increased in AD       versus controls (p < 0.001), predominantly displaying a disease-associated       microglial (HAM-like) phenotype (ABCA7(+)) with concurrent lipid-droplet       accumulation (PLIN3(+); LDAM phenotype). Spatially, glycolytic PKM2(+)Iba1(+)       microglia accumulated near Aβ plaques, p-Tau tangles, and cerebral vasculature.       Notably, their distribution around plaques/tau showed anomalous increasing       density with distance (p < 0.001), suggesting impaired chemotaxis. Perivascular       localization lacked clear chemotactic gradients. Functionally, overall phagocytic       activity (CD68(+)) decreased significantly in AD (p = 0.001), primarily       attributed to PKM2- subsets, whereas PKM2(+)Iba1(+) microglia exhibited       pronounced phagocytic exhaustion (PLIN2(+); p < 0.001), consistent around both Aβ       and p-Tau lesions (all p < 0.001). Our study establishes that       microglial glycolytic reprogramming via PKM2 promotes a proinflammatory HAM-like       phenotype, phagocytic exhaustion, and peri-pathological accumulation with       aggregates and cerebral vessels. Targeting glycolytic pathways represents a       viable therapeutic strategy for alleviating microglial dysfunction and       neuroinflammation in AD.	Journal of neuroinflammation	02/10/2025
10.1186/s12943-025-02447-y	Hsa_circ_0038737 promotes PARPi resistance in castration-resistant prostate       cancer via IGF2BP3-mediated DNPH1 mRNA stabilization.	Wang Z, Ge Q, Anwaier A, Liu S, Tian X, Zhang Z, Feng T, Hong Z, Ye D, Xu W, Qin X	Resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) poses a       major challenge to therapeutic efficacy in castration-resistant prostate cancer       (CRPC). Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in       cancer biology, their involvement in PARPi resistance remains largely       uncharacterized. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism       by which hsa_circ_0038737 modulates PARPi resistance in CRPC through       post-transcriptional regulatory pathways. We employed a comprehensive       set of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing,       RNA-protein pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, functional assays, and       xenograft/organoid models, to investigate the biological function and mechanistic       role of hsa_circ_0038737 in CRPC progression and therapeutic response. We identified hsa_circ_0038737 as a nuclear-enriched circRNA significantly       upregulated in CRPC, with expression levels correlating with poor prognosis and       aggressive clinical features. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0038737 interacts with       RNA-binding protein (RBP) IGF2BP3, enhancing the stability of DNPH1 mRNA, a       nucleotide sanitizer critical for DNA repair. The circRNA-RBP-mRNA regulatory       axis promotes PARPi resistance by facilitating DNA damage repair capacity.       Moreover, we revealed that reverse-complementary Alu elements mediate circRNA       biogenesis, with HNRNPDL facilitating this process. Pharmacologic inhibition of       DNPH1 effectively restored PARPi sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo.       Our findings reveal a novel hsa_circ_0038737/IGF2BP3/DNPH1 axis       driving PARPi resistance in CRPC, offering promising potential biomarkers and       therapeutic targets to overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes in       advanced prostate cancer.

10.1212/WNL.0000000000213904	Longitudinal Association of a Polygenic Risk Score for Plasma T-Tau With Incident       Alzheimer Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment.	Mourtzi N, Charisis S, Ntanasi E, Hatzimanolis A, Ramirez A, Sampatakakis SN, Yannakoulia M, Kosmidis MH, Dardiotis E, Hadjigeorgiou G, Sakka P, Mamalaki E, Papandreou C, Georgakis MK, Scarmeas N	Elevated levels of total tau (t-tau) are a key       biomarker of neurodegeneration, often seen in Alzheimer disease (AD). Identifying       individuals at increased risk of AD using minimally invasive biomarkers can       enable early intervention. We developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for plasma       t-tau and examined its association with the risk for developing clinical       endophenotypes of AD pathology. This longitudinal cohort study used data       from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) study,       involving individuals aged 65 years or older, free of AD, or amnestic mild       cognitive impairment (aMCI-an AD prodrome) at baseline. Our primary exposure was       PRStau, a PRS based on common genetic variants linked to plasma tau levels. The       primary outcome was aMCI or AD incidence. We assessed the association between       PRStau levels and aMCI/AD risk using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex,       education, APOE ε4 allele carriership, and population structure. We sought       replication in a sample of UK Biobank (UKB) participants aged 60 years or older       without prevalent dementia. In the HELIAD sample, among 618 cognitively       healthy participants (mean age 73.37 years, 58.4% female), followed for 2.92 ±       0.80 years, 73 developed AD/aMCI. A 1 SD increase in PRStau was linked to a 29%       higher AD/aMCI risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.290, 95% CI 1.006-1.654). Stratified       analyses revealed greater effect estimates in women (HR 1.451, 95% CI       1.023-2.058) and younger participants (HR 1.866, 95% CI 1.175-2.962), whereas       results in men and older participants did not reach statistical significance. In       the UKB sample (n = 142,637, mean age 64.2 years, 52% female), 2,737 participants       developed AD over 12.9 ± 2.4 years of follow-up. Higher PRStau was also linked to       increased AD risk (HR 1.046, 95% CI 1.007-1.086). These results       support the potential utility of PRS for plasma t-tau in predicting AD/aMCI       incidence. The relationship between genetic predisposition for elevated plasma       t-tau levels and AD pathology might be influenced by sex and age, suggesting that       these factors should be considered in AD genetic risk modeling. PRS could serve       as an early indicator of genetic propensity for tau pathology, enhancing existing       AD diagnostic and risk stratification algorithms.	Neurology	11/11/2025
10.1212/WNL.0000000000214214	Anti-Inflammatory Therapies for Atherosclerotic Stroke Prevention.	Georgakis MK, Melton P, Živković L, Kopczak A, Katsanos AH	Ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerosis is associated with the highest risk of       recurrence among stroke etiologies, highlighting a residual risk that current       secondary prevention strategies fail to address. Multiple lines of research       implicate inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including recent       large cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrating that anti-inflammatory       therapies can lower residual vascular risk in patients with coronary artery       disease. Notably, low-dose colchicine, a long-used anti-inflammatory drug, has       received approval for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with       atherosclerosis. However, translation of anti-inflammatory treatments to patients       with ischemic stroke has been challenging, with the first colchicine trials       showing neutral or conflicting results. In this study, we review the preclinical,       genetic, and epidemiologic literature linking inflammation to atherosclerotic       stroke; examine key findings of cardiovascular outcome trials for stroke       prevention; and summarize completed and ongoing stroke-specific trials. We       discuss the etiologic heterogeneity of ischemic stroke that may obscure       anti-inflammatory treatment effects, highlighting the need for precision medicine       approaches targeting patients with established atherosclerosis and vascular       inflammation. Finally, we provide an overview of the emerging anti-inflammatory       therapeutics that are under development for atheroprotection and outline a       translational roadmap to accelerate clinical impact in stroke prevention.

10.1007/s11033-025-11081-2	Unraveling the multifactorial pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome:       exploring lifestyle, prenatal influences, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and       post-translational modifications.	Senthilkumar H, Chauhan SC, Arumugam M	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, multifactorial metabolic and       endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women. This review discusses the       interlinked roles of lifestyle, metabolic dysregulation, insulin resistance,       neuroendocrine impairment, genetic predisposition, and post-translational       modifications (PTMs) in PCOS pathogenesis. Lifestyle components, especially those       leading to obesity and insulin resistance, worsen the hyperandrogenism, ovulatory       dysfunction, and inflammation. Dietary treatments such as, DASH diet and caloric       restriction, particularly along with metformin, have been proven to improve       metabolic and reproductive parameters. Environmental toxins, such as       endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs),       further compromise ovarian function and hormone regulation. Oxidative stress and       insulin resistance, driven by mitochondrial malfunction and chronic inflammation,       create a self-perpetuating vicious cycle that compromises oocyte quality and       worsens metabolic imbalance. Neuroendocrine disruption, characterized by       increased GnRH and LH pulsatility, is initiated by dysregulated kisspeptin,       dynorphin, and neurokinin B signaling in KNDy neurons, modified GABAergic input,       and increased AMH and androgens. PTMs such as phosphorylation, methylation,       acetylation, and ubiquitination also play essential roles in granulosa cell       function, AR signaling, insulin sensitivity, and oocyte maturation. Current and       novel treatment options vary from lifestyle modifications and pharmacological       interventions (e.g., metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, myoinositol, vitamin D,       and statins) to regenerative measures like mesenchymal stem cells and fecal       microbiota transplantation. Newer therapies focusing on PTMs and neuroendocrine       regulators remain the future hope. Multidisciplinary individualized management is       critical for successful PCOS therapy and averting long-term complications.	Molecular biology reports	04/10/2025
10.1186/s12902-025-02043-7	Efficacy and safety of variable-dose metformin as adjunctive therapy to insulin       in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and network       meta-analysis.	Li C, Qiao L, Li T	Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is complicated by insulin       resistance, dyslipidemia, and heightened cardiovascular risk. As adjunctive       metformin therapy lacks optimized dosing, we conducted a network meta-analysis       (NMA) to rigorously assess the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of metformin       combined with insulin in this population. Totally 764 adolescents (aged       10-19 years) met inclusion criteria were involved. We assessed five metformin       regimens: 1.0 g/day, 1.7 g/day, 2.0 g/day, weight-based       (≤ 60 kg:1.0 g/day;≥60 kg:2.0 g/day), and multi-tiered weight-based       (< 50 kg:1.0 g;50-75 kg:1.5 g;≥75 kg:2.0 g). Outcomes included HbA1c, BMI/BMI-Z,       insulin dose, lipid profile, and adverse events. A Bayesian NMA was performed       using R 4.4.1, with effect sizes reported as mean differences (MD) or relative       risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Surface under the cumulative       ranking curve (SUCRA) values ranked interventions. Consequently,       metformin 2.0 g/day significantly reduced BMI (MD=-0.6 kg/m², 95%-0.68, -0.52)       and LDL-C (MD=-12.78 mg/dL, 95%-21.17, -0.49) versus placebo. Doses of       1.0 g/day, 2.0 g/day, and the 60 kg weight-based regimen significantly reduced       daily insulin requirements. Metformin 2.0 g/day and the 50 kg weight-based       regimen reduced total cholesterol. No regimen significantly lowered HbA1c or       triglycerides versus placebo. All doses demonstrated safety profiles comparable       to placebo regarding gastrointestinal events, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis       (DKA), and transaminase elevations (RRs not significant). To sum up,       adjunctive metformin at 2.0 g/day offers significant benefits in weight       management, insulin dose reduction, and lipid improvement (LDL-C, total       cholesterol) for adolescents with T1D, with a favorable safety profile across all       doses, which will represent a viable therapeutic option.

10.1126/science.ads8728	GCN1 couples GCN2 to ribosomal state to initiate amino acid response pathway       signaling.	Zhou C, Zhang M, Murray J, Paulo J, Gygi S, Shao S, Whitman M, Keller T	During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell       survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is       activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to       its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions       of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is       unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by       amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse       translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome       sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner,       where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated       with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and       dynamics of GCN2 activation.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow       cytometry, and immunofluorescence, we found that thymus-derived Treg cells       infiltrate the injured spinal cord via peripheral blood around 3 days post-SCI.       Treg cell depletion worsened SCI and impaired long-term recovery. Transcriptomic       profiling revealed strong anti-inflammatory functions of Treg cells and the       potential to regulate cholesterol metabolism in neighboring microglia. Further       single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered the clonality of SCI-associated Treg cells.       Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression on microglia, not       macrophages, was crucial for sustaining Treg cell numbers and neuroprotective       function, with myelin-phagocytosing microglia-activated Treg cells showing       significant neuroprotective effects. Treg cells mitigated microglial inflammation       via CTLA-4 and upregulated the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (Abcg1)       receptor in microglia, helping to manage myelin load and reduce lipid droplet       formation. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into SCI-associated Treg cells       and lay the groundwork for future Treg-based therapies in SCI treatment.	Neuron	29/09/2025
10.1038/s41551-025-01509-2	Solid tumour CAR-T cells engineered with fusion proteins targeting PD-L1 for       localized IL-12 delivery.	Murad JP, Christian L, Rosa R, Ren Y, Buckley AJ, Lee EHJ, Lopez LS, Park AK, Yang J, Yamaguchi Y, Trac C, Adkins LN, Chang WC, Martinez C, June CH, Forman SJ, Ishihara J, Lee JK, Stern LA, Priceman SJ	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell efficacy in solid tumours is limited due       in part to the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME). To improve       antitumour responses, we hypothesized that enabling CAR-T cells to secrete       bifunctional fusion proteins consisting of a cytokine modifier such as       TGFβ(trap), IL-15 or IL-12, combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor such as       αPD-L1, would provide tumour-localized immunomodulation to improve CAR-T cell       functionality. Here we engineer CAR-T cells to secrete TGFβ(trap), IL-15 or IL-12       molecules fused to αPD-L1 scFv and assess in vitro functionality and in vivo       safety and efficacy in prostate and ovarian cancer models. CAR-T cells engineered       with αPD-L1-IL-12 are superior in safety and efficacy compared with CAR-T cells       alone and those engineered with αPD-L1 fused with TGFβ(trap) or IL-15. Further,       αPD-L1-IL-12 engineered CAR-T cells improve T cell trafficking and tumour       infiltration, and localize IFNγ production, TME modulation and antitumour       responses, with reduced systemic inflammation-associated toxicities. We believe       our αPD-L1-IL-12 engineering strategy presents an opportunity to improve CAR-T       cell clinical efficacy and safety across multiple solid tumour types.

10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.061	Fibrinolytic Therapy for Thromboembolic Diseases: Approved Indications and Future       Directions.	Rashedi S, Leyva H, Hamade N, Pfeferman MB, Ortega-Paz L, Sadeghipour P, Talasaz AH, O'Donoghue ML, Jimenez D, Monrea M, Anderson CD, Elkind MSV, Lang IM, Weitz JI, Goldhaber SZ, De Caterina R, Konstantinides SV, Piazza G, Krumholz HM, Braunwald E, Bikdeli B	Fibrinolytic therapy plays a pivotal role in the management of thromboembolic       diseases by promoting plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation and vessel       recanalization, which frequently comes at the cost of increased risk of       hemorrhagic events, including intracranial bleeding. Since the discovery of       streptokinase in 1933, several additional fibrinolytic agents have been       developed. Two plasminogen activators-urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator       (tPA)-were identified in human samples. Through recombinant DNA technology, tPA       was cloned and modified to produce alteplase. Subsequent efforts to prolong its       plasma half-life led to the development of mutant derivatives such as       tenecteplase and reteplase. Although fibrinolytic therapy in patients with       ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is currently restricted to those who       cannot undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention within 120 minutes of       presentation, it has been a mainstay treatment for acute ischemic stroke and       pulmonary embolism (PE) with hemodynamic compromise. Catheter-directed       fibrinolysis has been evaluated in patients with intermediate-risk PE, deep vein       thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, and after endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic       stroke. Fibrinolytic agents have also been used in other clinically important       indications, such as central venous access device thrombosis, mechanical       prosthetic valve thrombosis, left ventricular assist device thrombosis, central       retinal artery occlusion, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and left ventricular       thrombus. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current       applications, approved indications, evolving roles, and future directions of       fibrinolytic agents in thromboembolic diseases.

10.1016/j.drudis.2013.04.001	Sclerostin: how human mutations have helped reveal a new target for the treatment       of osteoporosis.	Robinson MK, Caminis J, Brunkow ME	In the 1990s there was a tremendous mood of optimism among pharmaceutical       scientists that identification of disease-associated variations in the human       genome would result in a surge of new drug targets (the 'gene-to-drug' mantra).       To date the expected deluge of new drugs has not arrived. However, a small number       of drugs arising directly from the study of rare human disorders showing       Mendelian inheritance are now entering late stage clinical trials. Here we       describe the advantages of this approach and discuss the background and early       clinical trial findings with antibodies directed at a target identified in this       way.

10.1038/s41467-025-63750-2	Platelet activation plays a pro-inflammatory role in myasthenia gravis.	Wen Q, Zhang S, Wang Y, Liu H, Wang J, Su S, Xie N, Lu Y, Di L, Xu M, Wang M, Chen H, Wang S, Zhu W, Wen X, Han J, Wan D, Zhao S, Lu W, Tao Z, Duo J, Huang Y, Chai G, Duan R, Li X, Hao J, Da Y	Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder that disrupts neuromuscular       junction function through autoantibodies. Platelets are emerging as key players       in the pathogenesis of MG, bridging innate and adaptive immunity. We analyze       platelet transcriptome signatures and their interactions with the immune system       in AChR+ immunotherapy-naïve MG (nMG) patients using bulk and single-cell RNA       sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). nMG patients exhibit       upregulation of genes related to activation, inflammation, and cytoskeletal       regulation. Increased platelet count, activation, altered morphology, enhanced       CD62P expression, and elevated plasma CD40L levels are observed in PBMCs, which       diminish with minimal clinical status (MMS). Functionally, platelets show       heightened interactions with leukocytes, forming aggregates that correlate with       disease severity. These features return to baseline after intravenous       immunoglobulin or prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. This study underscores       platelet activation's critical role in MG and supports platelet-targeted therapy.	Nature communications	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09571-1	A human-specific regulatory mechanism revealed in a pre-implantation model.	Fueyo R, Wang S, Crocker OJ, Swigut T, Nakauchi H, Wysocka J	Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional       studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and       epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the       blastocyst(1), to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a       hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We       uncover a pervasive cis-regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the       hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids.       Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own       species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is       essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the       primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds       to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular       functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating       recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a       transcriptional activator. Together, our results illustrate how recently emerged       transposable elements and genes can confer developmentally essential functions in       humans.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1186/s11658-025-00789-5	Programmed cell death in triple-negative breast cancer.	Liu Y, He J, Chen J, Chen T, Li W, Yang Z, Zeng F	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive and       therapeutically challenging subtype of breast cancer, defined by the lack of       estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor       receptor 2 expression. This absence of actionable molecular targets contributes       to its resistance to conventional treatments. This review provides an overview of       the mechanistic functions, interrelated processes, and therapeutic implications       of several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways-including apoptosis, pyroptosis,       necroptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis-in the context of TNBC pathogenesis and       treatment. A conceptual framework is proposed for leveraging these interconnected       cell death pathways as a basis for novel targeted interventions. Given the       complex interplay among various PCD forms characterized by shared features such       as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and overlapping molecular mediators,       this integrated network offers promising opportunities for combinatorial       therapeutic strategies. Modulation of one cell death pathway may influence       others, potentially amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, these PCD       pathways are highly relevant to immunotherapy outcomes, offering a foundation for       synergistic treatment modalities. This review provides an in-depth analysis of       the crosstalk between immune-based therapies and PCD, along with a comprehensive       discussion of derived therapeutic approaches. However, tumor diversity,       resistance mechanisms, and discrepancies between preclinical models and human       physiology pose major challenges in applying these findings clinically. The       overarching goal is to present innovative insights and strategies to enhance the       clinical management of TNBC and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.006	Sequencing-free whole-genome spatial transcriptomics at single-molecule       resolution.	Cheng Y, Dang S, Zhang Y, Chen Y, Yu R, Liu M, Jin S, Han A, Katz S, Wang S	Recent breakthroughs in spatial transcriptomics technologies have enhanced our       understanding of diverse cellular identities, spatial organizations, and       functions. Yet existing spatial transcriptomics tools are still limited in either       transcriptomic coverage or spatial resolution, hindering unbiased,       hypothesis-free transcriptomic analyses at high spatial resolution. Here, we       develop reverse-padlock amplicon-encoding fluorescence in situ hybridization       (RAEFISH), an image-based spatial transcriptomics method with whole-genome       coverage and single-molecule resolution in intact tissues. We demonstrate the       spatial profiling of transcripts from 23,000 human or 22,000 mouse genes in       single cells and tissue sections. Our analyses reveal transcript-specific       subcellular localization, cell-type-specific and cell-type-invariant       zonation-dependent transcriptomes, and gene programs underlying preferential       cell-cell interactions. Finally, we further develop our technology for the direct       spatial readout of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in an image-based, high-content CRISPR       screen. Overall, these developments offer a broadly applicable technology that       enables high-coverage, high-resolution spatial profiling of both long and short,       native and engineered RNAs in many biomedical contexts.

10.1016/j.molcel.2025.08.029	A needed nomenclature for nucleosomes.	Keogh MC, Almouzni G, Andrews AJ, Armache KJ, Arrowsmith CH, Baek SH, Bedford MT, Bernstein E, Côté J, David Y, Denu JM, Fierz B, Garcia BA, Glass KC, Gozani O, Helin K, Henikoff S, Jensen ON, Josefowicz SZ, Kelleher NL, Kutateladze TG, Lindner HH, Lu C, Luger K, Mallick P, Musselman CA, Muir TW, Paša-Tolić L, Schneider R, Shi X, Shi Y, Sidoli S, Smith LM, Tyler JK, Wolberger C, Workman JL, Strahl BD, Young NL	Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are crucial to eukaryotic genome       regulation, with a range of reported functions and mechanisms of action. Though       often studied individually, it has long been recognized that the modifications       function by combinatorial synergy or antagonism. Interplay may involve PTMs on       the same histone, within the same nucleosome (containing a histone octamer), or       between nucleosomes in higher-order chromatin. Given this, the field must       distinguish ever greater complexity, and the context in which it is studied, with       brevity and precision. The proteoform was introduced to define individual forms       of a protein by sequence and PTMs, followed by the nucleoform to describe the       particular gathering of histones within an individual nucleosome. There is now a       need to define specific forms of these entities in prose while providing space       for experimental nuance. To this end, we introduce a nomenclature that can       express discrete PTMs, proteoforms, nucleoforms, or situations where defined PTMs       exist in an uncertain context. Though specifically designed for the chromatin       field, adaptions of the framework could be used to describe-and thus dissect-how       proteoforms are configured in functionally distinct complexes across biology.

10.1186/s13062-016-0107-8	A paneukaryotic genomic analysis of the small GTPase RABL2 underscores the       significance of recurrent gene loss in eukaryote evolution.	Eliáš M, Klimeš V, Derelle R, Petrželková R, Tachezy J	"The cilium (flagellum) is a complex cellular structure inherited from       the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). A large number of ciliary proteins       have been characterized in a few model organisms, but their evolutionary history       often remains unexplored. One such protein is the small GTPase RABL2, recently       implicated in the assembly of the sperm tail in mammals. Using the       wealth of currently available genome and transcriptome sequences, including data       from our on-going sequencing projects, we systematically analyzed the       phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of RABL2 orthologs. Our dense       taxonomic sampling revealed the presence of RABL2 genes in nearly all major       eukaryotic lineages, including small ""obscure"" taxa such as breviates,       ancyromonads, malawimonads, jakobids, picozoans, or palpitomonads. The phyletic       pattern of RABL2 genes indicates that it was present already in the LECA.       However, some organisms lack RABL2 as a result of secondary loss and our present       sampling predicts well over 30 such independent events during the eukaryote       evolution. The distribution of RABL2 genes correlates with the presence/absence       of cilia: not a single well-established cilium-lacking species has retained a       RABL2 ortholog. However, several ciliated taxa, most notably nematodes, some       arthropods and platyhelminths, diplomonads, and ciliated subgroups of       apicomplexans and embryophytes, lack RABL2 as well, suggesting some       simplification in their cilium-associated functions. On the other hand, several       algae currently unknown to form cilia, e.g., the ""prasinophytes"" of the genus       Prasinoderma or the ochrophytes Pelagococcus subviridis and Pinguiococcus       pyrenoidosus, turned out to encode not only RABL2, but also homologs of some       hallmark ciliary proteins, suggesting the existence of a cryptic flagellated       stage in their life cycles. We additionally obtained insights into the evolution       of the RABL2 gene architecture, which seems to have ancestrally consisted of       eight exons subsequently modified not only by lineage-specific intron loss and       gain, but also by recurrent loss of the terminal exon encoding a poorly conserved       C-terminal extension. Our comparative analysis supports the notion       that RABL2 is an ancestral component of the eukaryotic cilium and underscores the       still underappreciated magnitude of recurrent gene loss, or reductive evolution       in general, in the history of eukaryotic genomes and cells."

10.1038/s41565-025-02017-9	Spatiotemporal-adaptive nanotherapeutics promote post-injury regeneration in       ageing through metabolic modulation.	Liang K, Zhao L, Zhang S, Zheng L, Zhang Z, Wang S, Chen J, Xu W, Wang W, Yang H, Song C, Qiu P, Zhao C, Fang W, Zhu J, Fan S, Liu Z, Tang R, Zhao Y, Fang X	In the elderly population, dysregulated cellular behaviour during the healing       process impacts tissue regeneration after injury. Early in the regeneration       process, pro-inflammatory macrophages contribute to immune imbalance, while in       later stages, senescent stem cells reduce regenerative capacity. Here we       demonstrate that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) can reprogramme both       types of dysfunctional cell. We developed a spatiotemporal-adaptive       nanotherapeutic system for the delivery of NAD(+) into selected cells during       different phases of tissue repair. By replenishing intracellular NAD(+) pools,       this system reshapes the multicellular regeneration niche, by metabolically       rewiring pro-inflammatory macrophages towards a pro-repair phenotype during the       early phase, and enhancing the differentiation capacity of senescent stem cells       at later stages. This strategy effectively restored impaired bone regeneration in       osteoporotic mice and accelerated skin wound healing. Our work presents a       spatiotemporal-adaptive nanomedicine platform that bridges cell metabolism,       nanomedicine and regeneration therapy.	Nature nanotechnology	01/10/2025
10.1093/braincomms/fcaf337	Systemic increase of AMPA receptors associated with cognitive impairment of long       COVID.	Fujimoto Y, Abe H, Eiro T, Tsugawa S, Tanaka M, Hatano M, Nakajima W, Ichijo S, Arisawa T, Takada Y, Kimura K, Sano A, Hirahata K, Sasaki N, Kimura Y, Takahashi T	Long COVID primarily presents with persistent cognitive impairment (Cog-LC),       imposing a substantial and lasting global burden. Even after the pandemic, there       remains a critical global need for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies       targeting Cog-LC. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly       understood. Given the central role of synapses in brain function, investigation       of synaptic molecular changes may provide vital insights into Cog-LC       pathophysiology. In this study, we used [(11)C]K-2 PET to characterize the       density of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) on the post-synaptic cell surface, which are       crucial synaptic components in brain signalling. Statistical parametrical mapping       was used to spatially normalize and apply independent t-test for a voxel-based       comparison. We selected patients with Cog-LC (n = 30) based on Repeatable Battery       for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status assessed persistent cognitive       impairment and healthy controls (n = 80) with no diagnosed neuropsychiatric       disorders. The primary objective was to compare [(11)C]K-2 standardized uptake       value ratio with white matter (SUVR(WM)) as a reference region between patients       with Cog-LC and healthy controls, and to define the regional extent of       differences. The secondary objective was to examine associations between       [(11)C]K-2 SUVR(WM) and plasma concentrations of cytokines or chemokines. As an       exploratory objective, we tested whether [(11)C]K-2 PET data could distinguish       Cog-LC from healthy controls using a partial least squares based classification       algorithm. A voxel-based comparison (P < 0.05, T > 1.66, one-tailed, false       discovery rate control) and a volume of interests analysis (P < 0.05, Bonferroni       multiple comparison) demonstrated that increased index of AMPAR density in large       parts of the brains of patients with Cog-LC compared with that in healthy       controls. A voxel-based correlation analysis also showed the brain regions where       [(11)C]K-2 SUVR(WM) correlated positively with plasma TNFSF12 and negatively with       plasma CCL2 concentrations. A partial least squares model trained on the index of       AMPAR density data demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving 100%       sensitivity and 91.2% specificity. [(11)C]K-2 PET signal represents the index of       AMPAR density on the post-synaptic neural cell surface, not on the glial cell       surface. A systemic increase in synaptic AMPARs across the brain may drive       abnormal information processing in Cog-LC and, through excessive excitatory       signalling, pose a risk of excitotoxic neuronal damage. We derived the hypothesis       that [(11)C]K-2 PET would be helpful in establishing a diagnostic framework for       Cog-LC and that antagonists for cell surface AMPARs, such as perampanel, would be       a potential therapeutic target. These hypotheses should be investigated in future       large-scale clinical studies.	Brain communications	01/01/2025
10.1126/sciimmunol.ads0449	The immunology of brain tumors.	Bunse L, Bunse T, Kilian M, Quintana FJ, Platten M	Brain tumors represent a unique challenge for cancer immunotherapies because of       their location in an immune privileged site. However, the brain tumor immune       microenvironment is dictated more by tumor type than the location within the       brain per se. This feature is reflected by the higher immunogenicity and response       to immunotherapies of metastatic brain tumors compared with primary brain tumors.       Immunotherapies for brain tumors aim at inducing and boosting tumor T cell       responses using vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or adoptive T cell       therapies. A fundamental challenge in the field is how such brain tumor-targeting       T cells gain access to brain tumors and maintain their function despite a hostile       immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we review current knowledge of the       cellular and molecular determinants of the antigenicity of brain tumors and the       immunosuppressive brain tumor microenvironment. Expanding and exploiting this       knowledge will provide the key for effective combinatorial therapies.	Science immunology	03/10/2025
10.1186/s12889-025-24746-1	Associations between sarcopenic obesity and risk of falls: a population-based       cohort study among middle-aged and older adults using the CHARLS.	Yu C, Meng Z, Wang X, Xiao J	Although previous research has established a strong link between       sarcopenia and fall risk in middle-aged and older adults, the effects of       sarcopenic obesity and possible sarcopenic obesity on fall risk remain       underexplored in large-scale studies. This longitudinal analysis aimed to examine       these associations using nationally representative cohort data. We       analyzed data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS),       including 9,996 participants aged 45 and older with available body composition       measurements. Participants were categorized into four groups based on Asian       Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria and median waist circumference (WC):       (1) normal WC without sarcopenia (control group), (2) normal WC with sarcopenia,       (3) obesity without sarcopenia, and (4) obesity with sarcopenia. Cox proportional       hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence       intervals (CIs), and P-values, with the control group as the reference. The model       was sequentially adjusted for demographic (age, sex, residence), socioeconomic       (education), and behavioral (smoking, alcohol) variables. Compared to       participants with normal WC and no sarcopenia (reference group), those with       sarcopenic obesity had a significantly higher risk of falls (HR = 1.25; 95% 1.00-1.56; P = 0.048), even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and       behavioral factors. Similarly, possible sarcopenic obesity was linked to a modest       but statistically significant increase in fall risk (HR = 1.12; 95% 1.02-1.24; P = 0.021). Subgroup analyses revealed that the fourth quartile showed       a trend toward higher fall risk across all subgroups, especially among       individuals aged ≥ 60 years and males. However, in most Subgroups, the 95% CIs       cross 1, suggesting limited statistical significance in some strata. Both sarcopenic obesity and possible sarcopenic obesity are associated with an       elevated risk of falls. Middle-aged and older adults should adopt preventive       strategies, such as maintaining regular physical activity, to preserve muscle       mass and reduce the risk of falls.

This study evaluated a dexamethasone-sparing regimen of       daratumumab plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in frail       patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. In this prospective,       randomised, open-label trial, conducted at 61 active Intergroup Francophone of       Myeloma centres, patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple       myeloma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group proxy frailty score of 2 or       more were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive daratumumab (1800 mg subcutaneously)       plus oral lenalidomide (25 mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle) and       dexamethasone (20mg weekly) for two cycles (dexamethasone-sparing group) or       lenalidomide (25 mg daily) and oral dexamethasone (20 mg weekly; control group),       with stratification by International Staging System, age, and centre. The primary       endpoint was progression-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the       intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients exposed to       at least one dose of randomised intervention. This trial is registered with       ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03993912, and is complete. From Oct 18, 2019 to       July 20, 2021, 335 patients were screened, of whom 295 patients were randomly       assigned (200 to lenalidomide plus daratumumab, 95 to lenalidomide plus       dexamethasone). The median age was 81 years (IQR 77-84), with 180 (61%) aged       older than 80 years, and 151 (51%) patients were female and 144 (49%) were male.       Median follow-up was 46·3 months (IQR 46·0-52·7). Median progression-free       survival was 53·4 months (95% CI 35·3-not reached) in the dexamethasone-sparing       group versus 22·5 months (16·5-39·0) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR]       0·51, 95% CI 0·37-0·70, p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-5 AEs were neutropenia       (110 [55%] of 200 patients in the dexamethasone-sparing group vs 23 [24%] of 95       patients in the control group), and infection (38 [19%] vs 20 [21%]). Serious       adverse events occurred in 126 patients (63%) in the dexamethasone-sparing group       and 66 patients (69%) in the control group. AEs leading to death occurred in 23       patients (12%) in the dexamethasone-sparing group and 12 patients (13%) in the       control group, with 4 (2%) and 2 (2%) grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse events,       respectively. In the IFM2017-03 trial, use of lenalidomide plus       daratumumab, with dexamethasone limited to the first 2 treatment cycles, reduced       the risk of progression or death compared with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone,       with no additional safety concerns. Lenalidomide plus daratumumab could therefore       be considered as a treatment option for older patients with frailty and newly       diagnosed multiple myeloma.

10.1038/s41588-025-02336-6	Targeting histone H2B acetylated enhanceosomes via p300/CBP degradation in       prostate cancer.	Luo J, Chen Z, Qiao Y, Tien JC, Young E, Mannan R, Mahapatra S, Bhattacharyya R, Xiao L, He T, Eyunni S, Zhang Y, Zheng Y, Su F, Cao X, Wang R, Cheng Y, Seri R, George J, Shahine M, Miner SJ, Rees MG, Ronan MM, Roth JA, Vaishampayan U, Wang M, Wang S, Parolia A, Chinnaiyan AM	Prostate cancer is driven by oncogenic transcription factor enhanceosomes       comprising chromatin and epigenetic regulators. The lysine acetyltransferases       p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key cofactors that activate enhancers       through histone acetylation. Here we identify p300/CBP-mediated multisite histone       H2B N-terminal acetylation (H2BNTac) as a defining feature of oncogenic       enhanceosomes in androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer. p300/CBP are       essential for AR and ETS transcription factor ERG transcriptional activity, and       their dual degradation eliminates H2BNTac and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation at       hyperactive enhancers, leading to stronger suppression of oncogenic transcription       than targeting either paralog or bromodomain alone. Cytotoxicity profiling across       >900 cell lines revealed that tumors with high H2BNTac, including AR-positive       prostate cancer, are selectively dependent on p300/CBP. In preclinical models,       systemic p300/CBP degradation inhibited tumor growth, synergized with AR       antagonists and showed no evident toxicity. These findings position H2BNTac as an       epigenetic marker of enhancer addiction and establish dual p300/CBP degradation       as a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancer-driven cancers.

Wu K, Zheng C, Cao Q, Ding Y, Gao X, Zhong J, Chiu CT, Zhang H, Wang X, Wang B, Liang J, Liu X, Zhou Y, Xu B, Kim TO, Shen X, Chen D, Chen W, Liu Y, Shen J, Liu F, Ding X, Zhan Q, Chou JW, Zeng S, Lin Y, Ying L, Chen X	Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)       receptor modulator for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. In the       randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 ENLIGHT UC study, also known       as the ES101002 study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod       in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in East Asia.       Using a central interactive web response system, in the 12-week       induction period, adults (aged 18-75 years, inclusive) with moderately to       severely active ulcerative colitis (modified Mayo score [MMS] 4-9 with an       endoscopic subscore ≥2 and a rectal bleeding subscore ≥1) and an inadequate       response, loss of response, or intolerance to at least one ulcerative colitis       treatment were randomly assigned (2:1) to once-daily oral etrasimod 2 mg or       placebo. Patients and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. Patients       were enrolled from 52 hospitals across China, Taiwan, and Souh Korea.       Randomisation was stratified by previous treatment status and baseline disease       activity. Patients who had an MMS clinical response at induction period week 12       were re-randomly assigned (1:1) to once-daily oral etrasimod 2 mg or placebo for       the 40-week maintenance period. Randomisation was stratified by induction period       treatment, previous exposure to biologicals or JAK inhibitors, and concomitant       use of oral corticosteroids at induction period baseline. The primary efficacy       outcome was MMS clinical remission (stool frequency subscore=0 [or stool       frequency subscore=1 with a ≥1 point decrease from induction period baseline],       rectal bleeding subscore=0, and endoscopic subscore ≤1 [excluding friability]),       assessed in the induction and maintenance periods separately (at induction period       week 12 and maintenance period week 40). The primary efficacy analyses used the       full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients who were randomly assigned       and received at least one dose of study treatment for the induction period, and       all re-randomly assigned patients who showed clinical response at induction       period week 12 and received at least one dose of study treatment for the       maintenance period. The safety analyses for each treatment period used the safety       analysis set (SAF), which included all patients who received any amount of study       drug in the corresponding treatment period. ENLIGHT UC is registered with       ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04176588) and the study is complete. 606       patients were screened between Sept 25, 2019, and April 27, 2023, and 340 were       randomly assigned for the induction period and treated (228 patients [88       female and 140 male] assigned to etrasimod and 112 patients [44 female and 68       male] assigned to placebo). 157 patients who showed clinical response in the       induction period were re-randomly assigned and treated in the maintenance period       (77 patients [35 female and 42 male] assigned to etrasimod and 80 patients       [32 female and 48 male] assigned to placebo). A significantly greater proportion       of patients treated with etrasimod than those treated with placebo, showed       clinical remission at induction week 12 (57 [25·0%] of 228 patients vs six [5·4%]       of 112 patients; adjusted difference 20·4%; 95% CI 13·4%-27·4%; p<0·0001) and       maintenance period week 40 (37 [48·1%] of 77 patients vs 10 [12·5%] of 80       patients; adjusted difference 35·9%; 95% CI 22·5%-49·2%; p<0·0001). In the       induction period, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event       (TEAE) was increased ALT (22 [10%] in the etrasimod group vs one [1%] in the       placebo group). In the maintenance period, the most frequently reported TEAE was       upper respiratory tract infection (14 [18%] in the etrasimod group vs 14 [17%] in       the placebo group). Across the induction and maintenance periods, most TEAEs were       mild to moderate in severity. Five (2%) of 228 patients treated with etrasimod       and four (4%) of 112 patients treated with placebo discontinued study treatment       due to TEAEs during the induction period, and one (1%) of 77 patients treated       with etrasimod and one (1%) of 81 patients treated with placebo discontinued       study treatment due to TEAEs during the maintenance period. No grade 4 or higher       TEAE, malignancies, or deaths were reported. Etrasimod was       effective and well tolerated as an oral induction and maintenance treatment in       patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in East Asia.

10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00569	Measurement of Organ-Specific and Acute-Phase Blood Protein Levels in Early Lyme       Disease.	Zhou Y, Qin S, Sun M, Tang L, Yan X, Kim TK, Caballero J, Glusman G, Brunkow ME, Soloski MJ, Rebman AW, Scavarda C, Cooper D, Omenn GS, Moritz RL, Wormser GP, Price ND, Aucott JN, Hood L	Lyme disease results from infection of humans with the spirochete Borrelia       burgdorferi. The first and most common clinical manifestation is the circular,       inflamed skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans; later manifestations result       from infections of other body sites. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease can be       challenging in patients with erythema migrans because of the time delay in the       development of specific diagnostic antibodies against Borrelia. Reliable blood       biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with erythema       migrans are needed. Here, we performed selected reaction monitoring, a targeted       mass spectrometry-based approach, to measure selected proteins that (1) are known       to be predominantly expressed in one organ (i.e., organ-specific blood proteins)       and whose blood concentrations may change as a result of Lyme disease, or (2) are       involved in acute immune responses. In a longitudinal cohort of 40 Lyme disease       patients and 20 healthy controls, we identified 10 proteins with significantly       altered serum levels in patients at the time of diagnosis, and we also developed       a 10-protein panel identified through multivariate analysis. In an independent       cohort of patients with erythema migrans, six of these proteins, APOA4, C9, CRP,       CST6, PGLYRP2, and S100A9, were confirmed to show significantly altered serum       levels in patients at time of presentation. Nine of the 10 proteins from the       multivariate panel were also verified in the second cohort. These proteins,       primarily innate immune response proteins or proteins specific to liver, skin, or       white blood cells, may serve as candidate blood biomarkers requiring further       validation to aid in the laboratory diagnosis of early Lyme disease.

10.1248/bpb.b15-00842	Mechanism Underlying Induction of Hyperglycemia in Rats by Single Administration       of Olanzapine.	Nagata M, Nakajima M, Ishiwata Y, Takahashi Y, Takahashi H, Negishi K, Yasuhara M	Acute administration of olanzapine rapidly elevates blood glucose levels.       However, the mechanism underlying the rapid development of hyperglycemia with the       administration of olanzapine remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to       clarify the mechanism underlying olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia. Male       Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of saline (control) or olanzapine       2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were obtained periodically after olanzapine       infusion to determine serum concentrations of glucose, olanzapine, and several       endogenous substances. In a separate experiment, rats received an intravenous       injection of propranolol (2 mg/kg) 30 min before infusion of olanzapine       (10 mg/kg). The intravenous infusion of olanzapine induced dose-dependent       increases in the serum concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, and insulin.       Pretreatment with propranolol suppressed olanzapine-induced elevations in the       serum concentration of glucose, but did not affect the serum concentration of       olanzapine or olanzapine-induced increase in the serum concentration of       epinephrine. Although the serum concentration of corticosterone increased after       administration of olanzapine, no significant differences were observed among the       olanzapine dose groups. Furthermore, administration of olanzapine did not affect       the serum concentration of glucagon or histamine. We developed a       pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model assuming that the olanzapine-induced       secretion of epinephrine leads to elevated serum glucose concentrations. This       model appeared to satisfactorily characterize olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia.       In conclusion, a single intravenous dose of olanzapine dose-dependently increased       the serum concentration of glucose in rats, and epinephrine plays a role in       olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia.

Di Federico A, Wang K, Chen MF, Barsouk AA, Pagliaro A, Chen LN, Ogliari FR, Stockhammer P, Thawani R, Raslan S, Gariazzo E, Fusco F, Hambelton GM, Citarella F, Meyer D, Aldea M, De Giglio A, Alessi JV, Pecci F, Gelsomino F, Corassa M, Vokes NI, Wang X, de Biase D, Abu Rous F, Areesawangkit P, Elghawy O, Cortellini A, Metro G, Ferrara R, Awad MM, Pabani A, Murray JC, Cappuzzo F, Garassino MC, Dagogo-Jack I, Riely G, Grant M, Herzberg BO, Ardizzoni A, Planchard D, Johnson BE, Langer CJ, Offin M, Negrao MV, Ricciuti B	Patients with BRAF(V600E) (ie, Val600Glu)-mutated non-small-cell lung       cancer (NSCLC) can be treated with BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase       (MEK) inhibitors, or with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without       chemotherapy. We aimed to investigate which initial systemic treatment should be       prioritised in this population. In this retrospective cohort study       conducted across 17 centres in the USA, Italy, France, and Brazil,       clinicopathological data were collected from participants aged 18 years and older       with stage IV, treatment-naive, metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutated NSCLC and with an       Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-3, who started       first-line treatment with ICIs with or without chemotherapy (PD-1 or PD-L1       inhibitors with or without platinum-based chemotherapy) or BRAF and MEK       inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib or encorafenib and binimetinib) between Jan       2, 2015, and July 11, 2024. The primary endpoint was overall survival with       first-line ICIs with or without chemotherapy versus with BRAF and MEK inhibitors.       284 participants were identified for this study, of whom 88 (31%)       received ICIs with or without chemotherapy and 196 (69%) received BRAF and MEK       inhibitors. The median age of participants was 68 years (IQR 61-74), and 148       (52%) participants were female and 136 (48%) male. Participants in the ICIs with       or without chemotherapy group had a higher history of smoking (73 [83%] vs 118       [60%]; p=0·0002) and a higher PD-L1 expression (≥50% in 58 [66%] vs 76 [39%],       1-49% in 16 [18%] vs 67 [34%], and <1% in eight [9%] vs 31 [16%]; p=0·0003) than       those in the BRAF and MEK inhibitor group. At a median follow-up time of 45·0       months (95% CI 39·0-55·7), ICIs with or without chemotherapy were associated with       improved median overall survival compared with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (40·9       months [95% CI 33·3-not reached] vs 25·2 months [19·9-31·1]; hazard ratio [HR]       0·69 [0·49-0·98], p=0·039). In subgroup analyses, ICIs with or without       chemotherapy, compared with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, were associated with longer       median overall survival in participants with a history of smoking (HR 0·60       [0·40-0·90], p=0·013), with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of ≥1% or higher (HR       0·66 [0·45-0·98], p=0·039), aged 70 years or older (HR 0·54 [0·31-0·94],       p=0·029), with TP53 co-mutations (HR 0·46 [0·27-0·79], p=0·0048), and without       brain metastases (HR 0·66 [0·45-0·99], p=0·045). With BRAF and MEK inhibitors,       frequencies of adverse events of any grade and of grade 3 and higher were similar       whether administered as first-line therapy or as second-line therapy following       ICIs with or without chemotherapy. First-line ICIs with or       without chemotherapy were associated with improved overall survival compared with       BRAF and MEK inhibitors in participants with metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutated       NSCLC, particularly among specific subpopulations. These findings, although       suggesting potential clinical relevance, remain exploratory and require       confirmation from prospective studies. NextGenerationEU.	The Lancet. Oncology	01/01/2045
10.1186/s12943-025-02458-9	Microbiome-metabolome interplay in pancreatic cancer progression: insights from       multi-omics analysis.	Luo D, Chen Q, Li Y, Yang J, Tao Y, Ji L, Gong X	Recent studies suggest that intratumoral microbiome and altered       metabolic networks play crucial roles in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression.       However, the precise interplay between microbial communities and tumor metabolism       in PC remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of the       intratumoral microbiome, the metabolic landscape, and their interactions on PC       development. 16S rDNA sequencing and Untargeted metabolomic profiling       were performed on 47 paired pancreatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues to       analyze their intratumoral microbiome and metabolic landscapes. Bioinformatics       tools were used to conduct differential microbiome abundance analysis and pathway       enrichment. A correlation analysis was performed to identify key       microbiota-metabolite interactions. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed       significant differences in the abundance and diversity (α-diversity and       β-diversity) of the intratumoral microbiome in PC. The predominant species in       pancreatic cancer were Pseudomonas. Enrichment analysis showed that amino acid       metabolic pathways, including Arginine and Proline Metabolism, Arginine       Biosynthesis, were significantly enriched in PC. Untargeted metabolomics       identified 298 metabolites that were significantly altered in PC (fold       change > 1.5, P-value < 0.05). These included amino acid metabolites such as       Lys-Leu, Pro-Leu, Arg-Leu, Lys-Val, His-Lys, and others. Functional enrichment       analysis highlighted several metabolic pathways that play important roles in       pancreatic cancer, including Glycine, Serine, and Threonine Metabolism, Amino       Acid Biosynthesis, Metabolic Pathways and Cysteine and Methionine Metabolism.       Correlation analysis between microbiome and metabolic data revealed significant       associations between Pseudomonas and several metabolites, including       Alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, Myristic acid, Nonanoic       acid (the Spearman correlation coefficient r, 0.5 ≤|r|≤ 1 and P-value < 0.05).       This study suggests a relationship between the microbiome and       metabolism in pancreatic cancer. We observed that Pseudomonas contributes to       altered amino acid metabolism, but whether this interaction is causal and the       mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Further experimental validation is       required before considering microbiome-targeted metabolic interventions as viable       therapeutic strategies.	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025

Lu H, Wu Z, Wan M, Xiong S, Huang X, Liu T, Jiang X, He L, Ma C, Cui H, Yue X, Li J, Qin X, Wang Y, Zhang C, Yang J, Liu S, Zhang W	Obesity is a global health challenge significantly       increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden. Effective prevention and       treatment necessitate targeting early pathological changes, particularly       obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED). This study aimed to characterize ED       heterogeneity in non-hypertensive obese (NHO) individuals, investigate the       association of serum metabolites with obesity-induced ED, and identify       potentially predictive and therapeutic metabolites. Utilizing wire       myograph, this study assessed ED of ex vivo arterioles from omental adipose       tissue of 213 NHO patients, categorized into metabolically healthy obesity (MHO)       and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). Targeted metabolomic profiling       identified associations between serum metabolites and ED. Obesity-induced ED in NHO patients lacked correlations with many traditional       cardiovascular risk factors. The MHO and MUO individuals exhibited similar ED and       metabolomic profile characteristics. Serum metabolomics identified bile acids       (BAs), particularly chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), as negatively correlated with       ED in NHO patients. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), a taurine-conjugated       derivative of CDCA, protected against obesity-induced ED and hypertension.       Mechanistically, endothelial Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) deletion aggravated       obesity-induced ED and hypertension, negating the beneficial effects of bariatric       surgery or TCDCA treatment. The TCDCA-FXR activation in endothelial cells       upregulated ATF4 transcription, which was suppressed by PHB1, thereby enhancing       serine and one-carbon metabolism. This study suggests CDCA as a       promising biomarker for identification of obesity-induced ED.       Taurochenodeoxycholic acid demonstrates significant therapeutic potential for       alleviating various forms of obesity-induced ED. This effect is mediated by the       endothelial TCDCA-FXR-PHB1-ATF4 axis, which upregulates serine and one-carbon       metabolism, thereby offering a novel strategy to delay the onset of hypertension       and other CVDs.

Chen X, Yang Y, Yun D, Wang R, Lin Y, Luo M, Zhang W, Yu-Wai-Man P, Burton M, Liang L, Lin H	Ophthalmology, an early adopter of medical artificial intelligence (AI), has made       significant advancements, but ethical discussions limited. This bibliometric       analysis reviewed 498 publications from Web of Science and Scopus (2000-2023) to       explore the evolution, status, thematic trends, data modalities and their ethical       focus, and solutions in ophthalmic AI ethics. Ophthalmology ranks second in       medical AI ethics, with major contributors from the United States (US), China,       the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore and India. Ethical concerns focus on privacy,       fairness, and transparency. Ethical priorities differ by modality with fundus       imaging (59.4%) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (30.9%) as the most       common. Most studies (78.3%) address ethics in diagnostic algorithm development,       while only 11.5% directly target ethical concerns, though this focus is       increasing. This study highlights the need for AI technologies and guidelines to       address ethical challenges in ophthalmology, offering a future direction for       research and innovation in medical AI governance.

Chen X, Yang Y, Yun D, Wang R, Lin Y, Luo M, Zhang W, Yu-Wai-Man P, Burton M, Liang L, Lin H	Ophthalmology, an early adopter of medical artificial intelligence (AI), has made       significant advancements, but ethical discussions limited. This bibliometric       analysis reviewed 498 publications from Web of Science and Scopus (2000-2023) to       explore the evolution, status, thematic trends, data modalities and their ethical       focus, and solutions in ophthalmic AI ethics. Ophthalmology ranks second in       medical AI ethics, with major contributors from the United States (US), China,       the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore and India. Ethical concerns focus on privacy,       fairness, and transparency. Ethical priorities differ by modality with fundus       imaging (59.4%) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (30.9%) as the most       common. Most studies (78.3%) address ethics in diagnostic algorithm development,       while only 11.5% directly target ethical concerns, though this focus is       increasing. This study highlights the need for AI technologies and guidelines to       address ethical challenges in ophthalmology, offering a future direction for       research and innovation in medical AI governance.

10.1016/j.redox.2025.103869	PARK7-driven IGF2BP3-K76 lactylation mediates ferroptosis and HAIC resistance in       hepatocellular carcinoma.	Zhu Z, Xia X, Lu Y, Li D, He X, Zhang B, Xiong G, Zhang W, Liang H, Zhu H	Oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (OXA/5-FU)-based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy       (HAIC) represents a promising strategy against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma       (HCC), yet acquired resistance frequently impedes its efficacy. Here, we identify       lactylation of IGF2BP3 at lysine 76 (IGF2BP3-K76lac) as a key driver of HAIC       resistance. IGF2BP3-K76lac overexpression enhances chemoresistance in vitro and       in vivo. Mechanistically, lactylation at IGF2BP3 K76 strengthens its affinity for       m6A-modified FSP1 mRNA, upregulating FSP1 and conferring ferroptosis resistance.       Blocking of IGF2BP3-K76lac bolsters OXA/5-FU-induced ferroptosis, disrupts       antioxidant defenses, and curbs tumor growth. Moreover, PARK7 functions as a       lactyltransferase to facilitate IGF2BP3-K76lac via increasing the binding of       lactate at IGF2BP3-K76 site. Finally, blocking antibody targeting IGF2BP3-K76lac       was shown to work synergistically with OXA/5-FU to restore chemosensitivity.       Taken together, our findings reveal a critical role for the       PARK7-IGF2BP3-K76lac-FSP1 axis in HAIC resistance, highlighting IGF2BP3-K76lac as       a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

10.1186/s12889-025-24558-3	Association of social isolation and loneliness with incident cancer in A       Population-based cohort study.	Liu X, Chen P, Wang J, Li Z, Zhu Y, Yang J, Wang L, He S, Sun X, Li J, Yang H	Social isolation and loneliness pose significant public health       challenges globally. This study aims to examine the association of social       isolation, loneliness and their combined effects with incident cancer. This study utilized data from the UK Biobank (UKB), which is a population-based       prospective cohort. Social isolation and loneliness were assessed through       self-reported questionnaires. Cancer cases were identified by linking to cancer       registries. A total of 430,376 participants were included, during a mean       follow-up of 14.32 years, 45,131 participants were diagnosed with cancer.       Compared to participants in least isolated group, those in most isolated group       had significantly higher risks of cancer of lip, oral cavity and pharynx (HR       1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.58), cancer of digestive organs (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.16),       cancer of respiratory and intrathoracic organs (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.28),       breast cancer (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18), cancer of female genital organs (HR       1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.38), and cancer of urinary tract (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17-1.46).       However, the most isolated group had lower risks of cancer of mesothelial and       soft tissue (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99), prostate cancer (HR 0.88, 95% CI       0.83-0.94). Individuals with loneliness had a significantly increased risk of       cancer of urinary tract (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40), but a reduced risk of cancer       of skin (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.93). Social isolation and loneliness       were independently associated with incident cancer, with implications for early       effective cancer prevention.	BMC public health	01/10/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09569-9	A miniature CRISPR-Cas10 enzyme confers immunity by inhibitory signalling.	Doherty EE, Adler BA, Yoon PH, Hsieh K, Loi K, Armbruster EG, Lahiri A, Bolling CS, Wilcox XE, Akkati A, Iavarone AT, Pogliano J, Doudna JA	Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving       oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral       systems(1). In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage       signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic       GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) in humans,       oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic       material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response(2-4). Here, in an       unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme       mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active       mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated       that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell       death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting       host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol       to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic       oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence       microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner       membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful defence strategy against       virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of the role of       oligonucleotides in immunity.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1002/ijgo.70577	Paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism risk: Evidence does       not support causal association.	Louwen F, Deuster E, McAuliffe FM, Jacobsson B, Geary M, Fleischman S, Kihara AB	Recent political statements linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during       pregnancy to autism spectrum disorders have created concern among patients and       healthcare providers worldwide. This editorial critically examines the scientific       evidence, highlighting that the largest and most methodologically rigorous       population-based studies employing sibling control analyses demonstrate no causal       association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental       disorders. While some observational studies have suggested potential weak       associations, these findings likely reflect confounding by indication and       familial genetic factors rather than actual causal relationships. The most robust       evidence comes from a Swedish population-based study of 2.48 million children,       which found no increased risk when controlling for familial confounding. Major       international medical organizations including ACOG, RCOG, and FIGO, and       regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency continue to recommend       paracetamol as the safest analgesic option during pregnancy when clinically       indicated. The established risks of untreated pain and fever during pregnancy       significantly outweigh theoretical concerns based on methodologically limited       studies. Healthcare providers should continue evidence-based counseling while       avoiding unnecessary anxiety about this essential medication in obstetric       practice.

10.1038/s41467-025-64173-9	Creative experiences and brain clocks.	Coronel-Oliveros C, Migeot J, Lehue F, Amoruso L, Kowalczyk-Grębska N, Jakubowska N, Mandke KN, Seabra JP, Orio P, Campbell D, Gonzalez-Gomez R, Prado P, Cuadros J, Tagliazucchi E, Cruzat J, Legaz A, Medel V, Hernandez H, Fittipaldi S, Altschuler F, Moguilner S, Baez S, Santamaria-Garcia H, González-Hernández A, Bonilla-Santos J, Güntekin B, Babiloni C, Abasolo D, Di Caterina G, Yener GG, Escudero J, Ochoa-Gómez JF, Soto-Añari M, Bruno MA, Valdes-Sosa PA, Anghinah R, Gonzalez-Montealegre RA, Clark RA, García AM, Kaltwasser L, Schürmann M, Meier JM, Brzezicka A, Whelan R, Lawlor B, Robertson IH, Bailey C, Melloni L, Sajnani N, Ibanez A	Creative experiences may enhance brain health, yet metrics and mechanisms remain       elusive. We characterized brain health using brain clocks, which capture       deviations from chronological age (i.e., accelerated or delayed brain aging). We       combined M/EEG functional connectivity (N = 1,240) with machine learning support       vector machines, whole-brain modeling, and Neurosynth metanalyses. From this       framework, we reanalyzed previously published datasets of expert and matched       non-expert participants in dance, music, visual arts, and video games, along with       a pre/post-learning study (N = 232). We found delayed brain age across all       domains and scalable effects (expertise>learning). The higher the level of       expertise and performance, the greater the delay in brain age. Age-vulnerable       brain hubs showed increased connectivity linked to creativity, particularly in       areas related to expertise and creative experiences. Neurosynth analysis and       computational modeling revealed plasticity-driven increases in brain efficiency       and biophysical coupling, in creativity-specific delayed brain aging. Findings       indicate a domain‑independent link between creativity and brain health.	Nature communications	03/10/2025
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.33512	Use of AI in Identification of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Anogenital       Dermatoses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Soe NN, Kusnandar II, Latt PM, Fairley CK, Chow EPF, Maatouk I, Johnson CC, Shah P, Peters RPH, Subissi L, Zhang L, Ong JJ	Artificial intelligence (AI) excels in dermatology. However, its       applications to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain unclear. To assess the performance of AI algorithms and their applications in detecting       STIs and anogenital dermatoses from clinical images in sexual health. Six databases (IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science, and       CINAHL) were searched for studies published from January 1, 2010, to April 12,       2024, using 3 main concepts: artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and sexually       transmitted infections. Studies that used AI to identify       anogenital skin conditions from clinical images were included. Studies that used       non-AI approaches or nonanogenital conditions, as well as reviews and studies       lacking performance metrics, were excluded. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses       (PRISMA) guidelines, 2 reviewers independently assessed full-text articles and       extracted data using a standardized spreadsheet. Another 2 reviewers resolved any       disagreements. A modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies       (QUADAS-2) critical appraisal tool and the Checklist for Evaluation of       Image-Based AI Reports in Dermatology (CLEAR Derm) were used for quality       assessment. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI       applications for detecting anogenital skin conditions. A bivariate random-effects       meta-analysis was conducted for conditions with more than 3 studies. Of       5381 studies screened and 258 full texts selected, 140 met the inclusion       criteria. Most studies reported on mpox (110 [78.6%]), while other anogenital       conditions, including genital herpes (7 [5.0%]), genital warts (8 [5.7%]),       scabies (8 [5.7%]), and molluscum contagiosum (6 [4.3%]), received less       attention. Meta-analyses showed high performance of AI for identification of mpox       (pooled sensitivity: 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]; pooled specificity: 0.98 [95% CI,       0.97-0.99]), herpes simplex (sensitivity: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.71-0.98]; specificity:       0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]), genital warts (sensitivity: 0.87 [95% CI, 0.67-0.96];       specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]), psoriasis (sensitivity: 0.90 [95% CI,       0.78-0.95]; specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), and scabies (sensitivity:       0.89 [95% CI, 0.84-0.93]; specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]). Study quality       was variable, and the assessment identified high risk of bias across the       population selection (76.1%), reference standards (76.1%), and index tests       (20.0%). Most studies relied on open-source datasets (121 [86.4%]); only 17       (12.1%) used external validation. All but 1 study (0.7%) remained at the       proof-of-concept stage, and models were not publicly available for external       evaluation. The findings suggest that AI shows promise       in identifying STIs and anogenital dermatoses but that significant research gaps       exist. Future work should prioritize understudied STIs and differential       conditions while improving data quality, conducting external validation, and       validating findings in clinical settings.

10.1016/j.molcel.2025.09.006	PARP1 auto-modification promotes faithful Okazaki fragment processing and limits       replication fork speed.	Elsborg JD, Munk SHN, Adelantado-Rubio A, Pék R, Fábian Z, Imburchia V, Zentout S, Hendriks IA, Buch-Larsen SC, Smith R, Bartek J, Duxin JP, Huet S, Maya-Mendoza A, Nielsen ML	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have proven their efficacy for       treating tumors defective in homologous recombination via synthetic lethality. In       response to DNA breaks, PARP1 is the primary ADP-ribosylation writer, modifying       itself (auto-modification) and other proteins to facilitate repair. However,       enzymatic inhibition blocks both processes, making it difficult to dissect their       distinct functional roles. Using proteomics and site-directed mutagenesis, we       identified a PARP1 mutant deficient in auto-modification, yet it retains       catalytic activity. This separation-of-function mutant revealed that PARP1       auto-modification slows DNA replication fork progression but is dispensable for       repair factor recruitment. Instead, auto-modification promotes the timely release       of PARP1 at DNA break sites and prevents the formation of replication stress.       Simultaneous inhibition of FEN1 and loss of PARP1 auto-modification gives rise to       synthetic lethality, implicating auto-modification in Okazaki fragment       processing. Our results demonstrate that trapping of PARP at DNA breaks impedes       repair factor accessibility, constituting an important dimension of       PARP-inhibitor-driven cytotoxicity.

10.1038/srep36943	Murine hypothalamic destruction with vascular cell apoptosis subsequent to       combined administration of human papilloma virus vaccine and pertussis toxin.	Aratani S, Fujita H, Kuroiwa Y, Usui C, Yokota S, Nakamura I, Nishioka K, Nakajima T	Vaccination is the most powerful way to prevent human beings from contracting       infectious diseases including viruses. In the case of the human papillomavirus       (HPV) vaccine, an unexpectedly novel disease entity, HPV vaccination associated       neuro-immunopathetic syndrome (HANS), has been reported and remains to be       carefully verified. To elucidate the mechanism of HANS, we applied a strategy       similar to the active experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model - one of       the most popular animal models used to induce maximum immunological change in the       central nervous system. Surprisingly, mice vaccinated with pertussis toxin showed       neurological phenotypes that include low responsiveness of the tail reflex and       locomotive mobility. Pathological analyses revealed the damage to the       hypothalamus and circumventricular regions around the third ventricle, and these       regions contained apoptotic vascular endothelial cells. These data suggested that       HPV-vaccinated donners that are susceptible to the HPV vaccine might develop HANS       under certain environmental factors. These results will give us the new insight       into the murine pathological model of HANS and help us to find a way to treat of       patients suffering from HANS.	Scientific reports	11/11/2016
10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3760	The Definition of Cure in Colon Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of 15 Randomized       Clinical Trials.	Pastorino A, Liu H, Pederson L, Martelli V, Iveson T, de Gramont A, Alberts SR, George TJ, Yothers G, Harkin A, Labianca R, Taieb J, Schmoll HJ, Twelves C, Wolmark N, Saltz LB, Souglakos I, Goldberg RM, Kerr R, Lonardi S, Yoshino T, Puccini A, André T, Shi Q, Sobrero A	The definition of cure in stage II to III colon cancer (CC) remains       unclear due to limitations in conventional end points, which include deaths and       second primary tumors as events. These can complicate communication with patients       regarding long-term outcomes. To distinguish relapses from competing       health-related events to classify long-term outcomes years after surgery and       explore when the incidence of true relapses of the initial CC approaches 0% to       define cure in this disease. DESIGN, SETTING, This pooled       analysis of individual patient-level data from 15 phase 3 randomized clinical       trials assessed time to CC-related relapse using Kaplan-Meier and Aalen-Johansen       methods, with death and second primary tumors treated as competing risks. Cox       regression models evaluated prognostic associations, stratified by sex, stage,       and tumor. Patients with stage II to III CC who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy       were included. All patients had undergone radical surgery for CC and received       adjuvant chemotherapy with a median follow-up of at least 6 years. The Adjuvant       Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) and the International Duration Evaluation of       Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) databases included adjuvant studies conducted       between 1996 and 2015. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to June 2025.       Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens varied across trials, including       fluoropyrimidines alone or in combination with oxaliplatin or biologic agents.       The primary outcome was time to CC-related       recurrence. The predefined threshold for cure was a recurrence risk below 0.5%.       Of 35 213 included patients, 19 346 (54.9%) were male, and the mean (SD)       age was 60.2 (10.8) years. The incidence rate of recurrence peaked at 6.4% (1993       of 31 373) between month 6 and month 12 and decreased continuously until year 10       of follow-up never exceeding 0.5%. Recurrence rate appeared to increase again       after year 10 and peaked at 2.0% during year 12.5 to year 13, a pattern observed       exclusively in the MOSAIC trial. Competing-event analysis revealed that death and       second primary tumors inflated the apparent recurrence rate, especially for older       patients. The overall cumulative incidence of relapse with death as competing       risk was lower among female patients (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76;       P < .001). In this pooled analysis of phase 3       randomized clinical trials, a recurrence rate less than 0.5% occurred after 6       years from surgery, supporting a practical definition of cure. Recognizing this       milestone may improve patient communication, guide follow-up duration, and reduce       unnecessary long-term surveillance.	JAMA oncology	02/10/2025
10.1038/s43587-025-00968-1	ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation alleviates chondrocyte senescence and serves as a       therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.	Wang K, He W, Gong Z, Gao J, Gao T, Pan N, Wu D, Yang Y, Li Z, Zhao X, Ji M, Shen S	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a whole-joint disorder that interferes with the quality of       life in older individuals. Here we report that ZDHHC11 is highly expressed in       articular chondrocytes but is downregulated in the degenerated cartilage of aged       mice and patients with OA. ZDHHC11 prevents chondrocyte senescence and promotes       cartilage anabolism, culminating in an improved OA phenotype. The deletion of       Zdhhc11 in mice (Zdhhc11(fl/fl)) exacerbates OA progression in a destabilized       medial meniscus model. Specifically, we identify ZDHHC11 as a key       palmitoyltransferase whose depletion leads to a GNB2-dependent E3 ubiquitin       ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation of APOD. Mechanistically,       ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation alleviates OA progression by deactivating the       GATA4-P65 signaling pathway. We also propose an original lipid nanoparticle-based       platform for Zdhhc11 mRNA delivery to rejuvenate impaired cartilage by       specifically targeting chondrocytes in vivo. Collectively, ZDHHC11-dependent       palmitoylation is essential for ameliorating OA, and the targeted delivery of       ZDHHC11 may serve as a promising strategy for future OA treatment.

10.1155/2024/9526283	Assessment of Meat Content and Foreign Object Detection in Cattle Meatballs Using       Ultrasonography, Radiography, and Electrical Impedance Tomography Imaging.	Ulum MF, Maryani, Rahminiwati M, Choridah L, Setyawan NH, Ain K, Mukhaiyar U, Pamungkas FA, Jakaria, Garnadi AD	Meat content and physically hazardous contaminants in the internal section of       meatballs cannot be detected by the naked eye or surface detectors. This study is       aimed at analyzing the meat content of cattle meatballs and detecting foreign       objects using ultrasonography (USG), digital radiography (DR), and electrical       impedance tomography (EIT). Meatballs were produced using four different meat       formulations (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% meat) and three treatments (no preservative       (control), borax, and formalin preservatives). Cast iron and plastic beads were       used as models of foreign objects embedded in the samples. The echogenicity,       opacity, and resistivity values of each sample were evaluated and compared across       groups. The results showed that the shelf life of the control meatballs was       shorter than that of meatballs with preservatives. The echogenicity and opacity       values for the different meat formulations were hypoechoic in USG and grey in DR.       USG was able to distinguish between control and preservative-treated meatballs       but could not differentiate meat content and detect foreign objects. Conversely,       DR effectively assessed meat content and detected iron-based foreign objects,       while EIT showed higher resistivity values for iron and plastic beads compared to       the meatball bodies.

10.1038/s41586-025-09580-0	Tracking clonal evolution during treatment in ovarian cancer using cell-free DNA.	Williams MJ, Vázquez-García I, Tam G, Wu M, Varice N, Havasov E, Shi H, Al-Rawi DH, Satas G, Lees HJ, Lee JJ, Myers MA, Zatzman M, Rusk N, Ali E, Shah RH, Berger MF, Mohibullah N, Lakhman Y, Chi DS, Abu-Rustum NR, Aghajanian C, McPherson A, Zamarin D, Loomis B, Weigelt B, Friedman CF, Shah SP	Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients       with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)(1). To study drug resistance in       patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome       sequencing(2) with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural       variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific       structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers,       enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of       co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this       approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from       diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from       selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis.       Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic       features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level       amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic       analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data(3) indicated pre-existing and       clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of       epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug       resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected       the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome.       Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at       diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at       relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed       adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.	Nature	01/10/2025

In this Consensus Statement, we used a Delphi approach       conducted across three rounds and involving 38 experts to identify crucial       elements required to report in tES studies. This consensus-driven approach       included the evaluation of the interquartile deviation (>1.00), the percentage of       positive responses (above 60%) and mean importance ratings (<3), hence ensuring       the creation of a robust and well-balanced checklist. These metrics were utilized       to assess both the consensus reached and importance ratings for each item.       Consensus was reached, leading to the retention of 66 out of the initial 70       items. These items were categorized into five groups: participants (12 items),       stimulation device (9 items), electrodes (12 items), current (12 items) and       procedure (25 items). We then distilled a shorter version of the checklist, which       includes the 26 items deemed essential. The Report Approval for Transcranial       Electrical Stimulation (RATES) checklist is relevant to those carrying out and       assessing tES studies, as it provides a structured framework for researchers to       consider and report. For reviewers, it can serve as a tool to assess       completeness, comprehensiveness and transparency of reports. In addition, the       RATES checklist aims to promote a deeper understanding of tES and facilitates       comparisons between studies within the field. Overall, the RATES checklist       provides a shared reference point that may improve research quality, foster       harmonization in reporting and, ultimately, enhance the interpretability and       reproducibility of findings in both research and clinical contexts.

10.1186/s12943-025-02439-y	P23 acts as a negative regulator of ferroptosis in NSCLC by blocking GPX4       degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy.	Chen J, Peng Y, Zhou M, Che Y, Zhao S, He C, Zhang W, Tian X, Zhang W, Liu Z, Zhou M, Liang G, Huo X, Wang Y, Yu Z, Ma X	Ferroptosis has been identified as a tumor-inhibiting event in a variety of       cancers; however, its molecular basis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has       not been completely elucidated. Notably, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) plays a       crucial role in ferroptosis. Our previous research revealed that prostaglandin E       synthase 3 (p23), a potential transcription factor, plays a crucial role in       promoting cancer progression and metastasis through succinylation. Our study       revealed a previously unknown antiferroptotic function of p23. Mechanistically,       p23 stabilizes GPX4 by competitively binding heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein       (HSC70) to suppress chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity, which       subsequently inhibits ferroptosis and accelerates tumor growth. Notably,       impairing p23 succinylation disrupts its interaction with HSC70, restoring       CMA-mediated GPX4 degradation. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting       p23-regulated CMA pathways represents a potentially viable strategy to modulate       ferroptosis in NSCLC.	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025
10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0947	Epigenetic regulation of chromosomal instability by EZH2 methyltransferase.	Bai Y, Agustinus AS, Yomtoubian S, Meydan C, McNally DR, Yoffe L, Hubisz MJ, Tranquille M, Pramod S, Hong C, Plasilova ML, Kapoor AR, Singh A, Withers H, Dow LE, Laughney AM, Bhinder B, Elemento O, Melnick AM, Bakhoum SF, Mittal V	Chromosomal instability (CIN) and epigenetic reprogramming are central drivers of       breast cancer progression, yet the mechanisms connecting them remain elusive. We       uncover a direct role of EZH2 histone methyltransferase in promoting CIN in       triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Across breast cancers, EZH2 expression       correlates with copy number alterations, and its catalytic activity is associated       with increased CIN in metastasis-initiating cells. Pharmacological EZH2       inhibition suppressed CIN, revealing an unexpected vulnerability. Integrated       chromatin and transcriptome profiling identified Tankyrase (TNKS), a       poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as a direct transcriptional target of EZH2.       Mechanistically, EZH2-mediated TNKS suppression disrupts CPAP (centrosomal       P4.1-associated protein), driving centrosome overduplication, multipolar mitosis       and exacerbated CIN. In vivo, CIN suppression is a critical mechanism underlying       the anti-metastatic effects of EZH2 inhibition. These findings delineate a       previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism governing CIN and establish EZH2       inhibitors as the first therapeutic agents capable of directly suppressing CIN,       underscoring the need for trials with metastasis-focused endpoints.

10.1186/s12985-025-02928-y	Human endogenous retrovirus ERVK3-1 characterizes a metabolically active and       immunosuppressive subtype of liver cancer.	Wen X, Weng S, Chen M, Lin D, Xue W, Zeng D, Shen J	Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), particularly the HERV-K       family, are increasingly recognized for their roles in cancer biology, yet the       function of ERVK3-1 (HERVK_3p21.31) in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC)       remains largely unexplored. We analyzed transcriptomic data from the       TCGA-LIHC cohort to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high       and low ERVK3-1 expression groups, followed by functional enrichment analyses       (GO, KEGG, GSEA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and hub       gene identification. The immunological relevance of ERVK3-1 was assessed through       TIP immune cycle analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, and correlation       with immune checkpoint expression. Immunotherapy responsiveness was evaluated       using TIDE and TCIA databases. High ERVK3-1 expression was associated       with enrichment in metabolic and oxidative stress-related pathways, while low       expression correlated with cell cycle and DNA replication. PPI analysis revealed       mitosis-related hub genes (e.g., CCNB1, CDK1). ERVK3-1 expression promoted early       immune cell recruitment but was inversely correlated with later stages of the       cancer immunity cycle, including immune infiltration and T-cell killing.       Single-cell data showed high ERVK3-1 expression in immunosuppressive subsets,       alongside positive associations with inhibitory immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1,       CTLA-4, TIM-3). High ERVK3-1 expression also correlated with greater immune       evasion and reduced immunotherapy responsiveness. ERVK3-1 plays a       multifaceted role in LIHC progression, contributing to metabolic reprogramming,       immune suppression, and resistance to immunotherapy. These findings highlight       ERVK3-1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in liver       cancer.	Virology journal	01/10/2025
10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00345-6	Assessing pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in renal cell carcinoma: a       systematic review and guidelines for sampling and reporting standards from the       International Neoadjuvant Kidney Cancer Consortium.	Blackmur JP, van der Mijn JCK, Warren AY, Browning L, Burgers F, Hirsch MS, Kapur P, Mehra R, Rao P, Signoretti S, Bex A, Stewart GD, van Montfoort ML, Jones JO	Pathological response is a surrogate marker of efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in       various tumour types, but there is no consensus on reporting pathological       response for renal cell carcinoma. We aimed to assess the status of pathological       response reporting in renal cell carcinoma and develop a recommendation on tissue       preparation and response reporting for neoadjuvant treatment. We conducted a       systematic review of publications on the PubMed and Web of Science databases to       identify manuscripts reporting response to pre-surgical therapy in renal cell       carcinoma. 119 eligible papers were identified. Only five (4%) studies included       details of how pathological response had been assessed. Qualitative statements on       residual tumour were common (55 [46%] studies), but only eight (7%) studies used       a quantitative assessment of pathological response. Guidelines for tissue       preparation and pathological response reporting were reviewed at an international       workshop held at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in October, 2024, and further       developed through expert discussions. To assess neoadjuvant pathological       response, nephrectomy specimens should be sampled with the use of a standardised       baseline approach with consideration for more extensive sampling. Microscopic       assessment should quantify the residual viable tumour in 10% intervals and       greatest linear extent. Clinical details, including the neoadjuvant therapy       received, should accompany the pathological assessment. In this systematic       review, we describe a standardised method for assessment and reporting       pathological response, initially intended for use in clinical trials or research       settings. These guidelines will help investigators to assess whether the degree       of pathological response is linked to survival outcomes and will inform future       standard reporting practices.

10.1136/jitc-2025-012991	Spatial transcriptomic profiling of metastatic renal cell carcinoma identifies       chemokine-driven macrophage and CD8+ T-cell interactions predictive of       immunotherapy response.	Kalogirou C, Krebs M, Kunz AS, Hahn O, Kübler H, Schwinger M, Hartmann A, Schmieder A, Eckstein M	Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) still lacks tissue-based       biomarkers that predict benefit from first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)       regimens. High-resolution spatial transcriptomics can dissect the tumor       microenvironment (TME) and reveal prognostic niches invisible to bulk assays,       offering a path toward precision immunotherapy. Formalin-fixed,       paraffin-embedded samples from 12 therapy-naïve patients with mRCC treated with       ICI-based combinations were profiled with 10x Genomics Visium and NanoString       COSMx. Six patients contributed matched metastatic lesions. Cell-type       deconvolution used robust cell type decomposition with a public single-cell       RNA-seq reference. Clinical outcomes (mean follow-up 16.75 months) were       correlated with spatial features. Validation employed Phase 2/3 JAVELIN Renal 101       as well as Checkmate 010/025 transcriptomic data. Spatial       transcriptomics uncovered pronounced divergences between primary tumors and       metastases in cellular composition and microarchitectural organization. Canonical       RCC molecular subtypes displayed marked intrapatient and interpatient spatial       heterogeneity, underscoring limitations of bulk classifications. Five recurrent       immune niches emerged across samples. One niche-rich in macrophages and CD8(+) T       cells and defined by chemokine signaling-was closely associated with objective       response in metastatic lesions yet absent or infrequent in matched primaries. A       gene signature reflecting this niche stratified responders within the       immuno-oncology (IO) -treated arms of JAVELIN 101 and CheckMate 010/025 trials.       On the other hand, signatures derived from angiogenic tumor cell-rich niches       defined responders within the comparator arms (tyrosine kinase       inhibitor/everolimus) in these trials. Metastasis-specific immune       niches, rather than primary-tumor characteristics, appear decisive for ICI       efficacy in mRCC. Spatial transcriptomic profiling can identify these clinically       relevant microenvironments and generate transferable gene signatures, supporting       biomarker-driven patient selection and trial design. Integrating spatial TME       analysis into future studies may accelerate personalized immunotherapy strategies       for mRCC.	Journal for immunotherapy of cancer	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41571-025-01075-1	Optimizing CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours: a clinical perspective.	Li J, Liu C, Zhang P, Shen L, Qi C	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is revolutionizing the management       of haematological malignancies but faces particular hurdles in the treatment of       solid tumours. In this Review, we discuss important advances in refining CAR T       cell therapy to provide practical clinical insights to address these challenges.       We describe key strategies, including target antigen selection to enhance       efficacy while minimizing on-target, off-tumour toxicities; early apheresis,       rapid manufacturing and frontline application to preserve T cell fitness and       ensure timely treatment; lymphodepletion to augment CAR T cell expansion;       locoregional delivery to maximize local therapeutic concentrations and reduce       systemic toxicity; and repeat infusions to prolong therapeutic effects.       Furthermore, we discuss advanced response evaluation frameworks that will be       essential for accurate assessment of the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies, and we       highlight the need for robust toxicity management approaches to mitigate severe       adverse events. By systematically addressing these multifaceted challenges, this       Review provides a comprehensive guide for the optimization of CAR T cell therapy       for solid tumours to enhance both efficacy and safety.

The ROME trial was a multicenter, randomized,       open-label phase 2 study comparing tailored treatment (TT) to standard of care       (SoC) in patients with advanced solid tumors progressing after one or two lines       of therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling on tissue and blood was performed to       identify actionable alterations. Overall response rate (ORR) was the primary       endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to       treatment failure (TTF), time to next treatment (TTNT) and safety were the       secondary endpoints. Between November 2020 and August 2023, 1,794 patients were       screened, 897 were evaluated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) and 400 were       randomized to TT or SoC. TT achieved a significantly higher ORR (17.5% versus       10%; P = 0.0294) and improved median PFS (3.5 months versus 2.8 months; hazard       ratio = 0.66 (0.53-0.82), P = 0.0002). TT also showed superior 12-month PFS rates       (22.0% versus 8.3%). Median OS was similar, with a 52% crossover rate. Grade 3/4       adverse events were also similar (40% TT versus 52% SoC). These results highlight       the potential of TT to improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable       genomic alterations. These results also provide relevant evidence supporting a       tumor-agnostic precision oncology strategy and highlight the potential of TTs,       guided by genomic profiling and MTB recommendations, to significantly improve       outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.35343	Cost-Utility Analysis of Accelerated and Standard Strategies for Renal       Replacement Therapy Initiation.	Round J, Akpinar I, Yan C, Patel N, van Katwyk S, Montgomery C, Wald R, Bagshaw SM	Little is known about the long-term costs and outcomes related to       strategies for timing of initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in       critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI). To       estimate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of accelerated KRT initiation       compared with standard KRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI.       DESIGN, SETTING, In this economic evaluation, a       state-transition model was developed using data from the Standard vs Accelerated       Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI (STARRT-AKI) trial, a multicenter,       multinational randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients with severe       AKI conducted between October 2015 and September 2019. Trial data were linked to       administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada, to estimate costs and       long-term clinical outcomes. The model included 4 health states: no chronic       kidney disease, severe chronic kidney disease, KRT dependent, and dead. Costs are       reported in 2024 Canadian dollars. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to       November 2024. Initiation of KRT. The       primary outcome for the economic evaluation was cost per quality-adjusted       life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY is a combined measure of patient quality of       life and length of life. Expected costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness       ratio (ICER), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were estimated on the       basis of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. A total of 146 patients from the       STARRT-AKI trial were included in the analysis, with 73 patients (mean [SD] age,       59.67 [14.5] years; 52 men [71.3%]) randomized to receive accelerated initiation       and 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.88 [12.9] years; 48 men [65.8%]) randomized to       receive standard initiation. Standard initiation was more costly per patient than       accelerated initiation (mean [SD], $251 370 [$155 801] vs $231 518 [$183 302])       but generated more QALYs (mean [SD] 7.49 [2.03] QALYs vs 6.64 [1.76] QALYs). The       ICER of standard initiation compared with accelerated initiation was $23 208,       with an INMB of $22 648 (95% credible interval, $15 980-$29 316) when assuming a       willingness to pay per QALY of $50 000. The findings       of this economic evaluation suggest that standard KRT initiation may be       cost-effective in a Canadian setting, but this finding was sensitive to       postdischarge cost trajectories and regional variation in KRT dependence.

10.1038/s43587-025-00962-7	Genome-wide analysis of brain age identifies 59 associated loci and unveils       relationships with mental and physical health.	Jawinski P, Forstbach H, Kirsten H, Beyer F, Villringer A, Witte AV, Scholz M, Ripke S, Markett S	Neuroimaging and machine learning are advancing research into the mechanisms of       biological aging. In this field, 'brain age gap' has emerged as a promising       magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarker that quantifies the deviation between       an individual's biological and chronological age of the brain. Here we conducted       an in-depth genomic analysis of the brain age gap and its relationships with over       1,000 health traits. Genome-wide analyses in up to 56,348 individuals unveiled a       heritability of 23-29% attributable to common genetic variants and highlighted 59       associated loci (39 novel). The leading locus encompasses MAPT, encoding the tau       protein central to Alzheimer's disease. Genetic correlations revealed       relationships with mental health, physical health, lifestyle and socioeconomic       traits, including depressed mood, diabetes, alcohol intake and income. Mendelian       randomization indicated a causal role of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes       in accelerated brain aging. Our study highlights key genes and pathways related       to neurogenesis, immune-system-related processes and small GTPase binding, laying       the foundation for further mechanistic exploration.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are       promising for risk stratification but are primarily developed in       European-ancestry populations. We aimed to develop and validate single- and       multi-ancestry PRSs for East Asian never-smokers to improve LUAD risk prediction.       PRSs were developed using genome-wide association study summary       statistics from East Asian (8,002 cases; 20,782 controls) and European (2,058       cases; 5,575 controls) populations. Single-ancestry models included PRS-25,       PRS-CT, and LDpred2; multi-ancestry models included LDpred2+PRS-EUR128, PRS-CSx,       and CT-SLEB. Performance was evaluated in independent East Asian data from the       Female Lung Cancer Consortium (FLCCA) and externally validated in the Nanjing       Lung Cancer Cohort (NJLCC). We assessed predictive accuracy via AUC, with 10-year       and (age 30-80) absolute risks estimates. The best multi-ancestry PRS,       using East Asian and European data via CT-SLEB (clumping and thresholding, super       learning, empirical Bayes), outperformed the best East Asian-only PRS (LDpred2;       AUC = 0.629, 95% 0.618,0.641), achieving an AUC of 0.640 (95% CI :       0.629,0.653) and odds ratio of 1.71 (95% CI : 1.61,1.82) per SD increase. NJLCC       Validation confirmed robust performance (AUC =0.649, 95% 0.623, 0.676). The       top 20% PRS group had a 3.92-fold higher LUAD risk than the bottom 20%. Further,       the top 5% PRS group reached a 6.69% lifetime absolute risk. Notably, this group       reached the average population 10-year LUAD risk at age 50 (0.42%) by age 41,       nine years earlier. Multi-ancestry PRS approaches enhance LUAD risk       stratification in East Asian never-smokers, with consistent external validation,       suggesting future clinical utility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the early super       responder (ESR) profile (at week 4) to bimekizumab. We       performed a multicenter retrospective study in 20 Dermatology outpatient clinics       in Turkey. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who were under       bimekizumab for at least 12 weeks were enrolled. A total of 341 adult       patients were included. 136 had nail psoriasis (39.9%), 148 had psoriatic       arthritis (PsA) (43.4%), 223 (65.4%) had at least one difficult-to-treat area       involvement, 155 (45.5%) were bio-naïve, 110 (32.5%) had ≥ 2 biologics history.       At week 4, PASI75 was achieved in 144 patients (49.8%), PASI90 was achieved in 88       patients (30.4%), PASI100 was achieved in 51 patients (17.6%). Family history       (p = 0.041), palmoplantar involvement (p = 0.008), PsA (p = 0.097), and       bio-experienced status (p = 0.060) were associated with lower odds of being an       ESR, whereas each 1-point increase in baseline PASI was associated with       significantly lower odds of ESR (p < 0.001). Gender, age, disease duration,       history of conventional systemic treatment, and presence of any comorbidity were       not significantly associated with the likelihood of being an ESR (all p > 0.05).       Bimekizumab is the effective treatment in both bio-naïve and       bio-experienced patients; however, it may have a more rapid onset of action in       bionaive patients. Further studies are needed on the long-term efficacy and       safety data of bimekizumab.	The Journal of dermatological treatment	01/01/2025
10.1186/s12887-025-06161-y	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the treatment modalities available for       children afflicted from cystic fibrosis.	Alruwaili TAM, Alanazi MF, Alruwaili BF, Fayed HK, Elsaeed M, Alnazi TD, Aljared A, Alanazi AMW, Alanazi AM, Alsharari SD, Alshammari A, Saad K	This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment       modalities in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and determine the superiority of       specific treatment modalities. A comprehensive literature search was       conducted using different search strings across multiple databases, including       PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, WOS, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google       Scholar, up to October 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control       studies and cohort studies were included. The triple therapy indicated a       significant reduction in CF-related complications, with an OR of 0.29 and an RR       of 0.54, accompanied by low heterogeneity (I² = 0% for both). Physiotherapy and       pulmonary exercises also yielded a beneficial effect, with an OR of 0.24 and an       RR of 0.49, without heterogeneity. In contrast, nutritional interventions       revealed non-significant outcomes (OR = 6.91 and RR = 2.63), suggesting the need       to re-evaluate these strategies. Ivacaftor alone did not achieve statistical       significance (OR = 0.34 and RR = 0.58), and the confidence intervals were broad,       indicating uncertainty in the effect estimates. Azithromycin exhibited a positive       effect on CF management, with an OR of 2.37 and an RR of 1.54. The overall pooled       OR across all treatments was 0.71, with an RR not computed due to substantial       heterogeneity (I²=93%). The study underscores the effectiveness of       certain treatments, such as triple therapy and physiotherapy exercises, for CF       while highlighting the considerable variability in treatment outcomes. Notably,       nutritional interventions need to be carefully reassessed. The findings emphasize       integrating physiotherapy and targeted pharmacological interventions into       standard CF management tailored to individual needs.	BMC pediatrics	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014	Very High Prevalence of Nonoptimally Controlled Traditional Risk Factors at the       Onset of Cardiovascular Disease.	Lee H, Huang X, Khan SS, Son D, Lee HH, Kim EJ, Lloyd-Jones DM, Kim HC, Greenland P	Recent studies suggest that coronary heart disease (CHD) may       frequently occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk       factors. However, it is unclear whether this could reflect missed clinical       diagnoses or subthreshold nonoptimal risk factor exposure preceding CHD, and       whether similar patterns are observed for heart failure (HF) or stroke.       The purpose of this study was to determine the antecedent occurrence       of nonoptimal levels of 4 traditional risk factors (blood pressure [BP],       cholesterol, glucose, and tobacco smoking) before first CHD, HF, or stroke.       We analyzed 2 population-based prospective cohorts: KNHIS (Korean       National Health Insurance Service) (n = 9,341,100; baseline age ≥20 years;       follow-up, 2009-2022) and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n =       6,803; baseline age 45-84 years; follow-up, 2000-2019). Among individuals who       developed incident CHD, HF, or stroke during follow-up, we determined the       prevalence of ≥1 traditional risk factor above optimal level-systolic BP ≥120 mm       Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg or BP-lowering treatment; total cholesterol ≥200       mg/dL or lipid-lowering treatment; fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or diagnosis of       diabetes or glucose-lowering treatment; or past or current smoking-at any visit       before CVD. Analyses were based on 601,025 and 1,188 CVD events in KNHIS       and MESA, respectively. Prevalence of ≥1 nonoptimal risk factor was high (99.7%       and 99.6%) before CHD, with similar patterns before HF (99.4% and 99.5%) and       stroke (99.3% and 99.5%) in both KNHIS and MESA, respectively. Prevalence of ≥1       risk factor before CVD was consistently high (>99%) across age groups in both men       and women, with the lowest proportion observed for HF and stroke (>95%) when       occurring at ages <60 years in women. Prevalence of ≥2 risk factors was also       common (93.2% to 97.2%) before CVD events. In this binational study       of 2 prospective cohorts, the presence of nonoptimal levels of ≥1 traditional       risk factor was nearly universal before CVD. These results not only challenge       claims that CHD events frequently occur without antecedent major risk factors but       also demonstrate that other CVD events, including HF or stroke, rarely occur in       the absence of nonoptimal traditional risk factors, highlighting the importance       of primordial prevention efforts.

10.1038/s41467-025-63987-x	Bacterial RNA promotes proteostasis through inter-tissue communication in C.       elegans.	Kyriakakis E, Medde C, Ritz D, Fucile G, Schmidt A, Spang A	Life expectancy has been increasing over the last decades, which is not matched       by an increase in healthspan. Besides genetic composition, environmental and       nutritional factors influence both health- and lifespan. Diet is thought to be a       major factor for healthy ageing. Here, we show that dietary RNA species improve       proteostasis in C. elegans. Inherent bacterial-derived double stranded RNA       reduces protein aggregation in a C. elegans muscle proteostasis model. This       beneficial effect depends on low levels of systemic selective autophagy, the RNAi       machinery in the germline, even when the RNA is delivered through ingestion in       the intestine and the integrity of muscle cells. Our data suggest a requirement       of inter-organ communication between the intestine, the germline and muscles. Our       results demonstrate that bacterial-derived RNAs elicit a systemic response in C.       elegans, which protects the animal from protein aggregation during ageing, which       might extend healthspan.

10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.119155	Deciphering the carcinogenic role of benzo[a]pyrene in glioblastoma: Insights       from network toxicology, single-cell transcriptomics, and Mendelian       randomization.	Yi L, Wang W, Sun Z, Chen Y, Xiong Z, Ma L, Ye W, Li X	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a known environmental carcinogen linked to       multiple tumors, but its role in glioblastoma (GBM) remains poorly understood.       This study aimed to explore BaP's tumorigenic mechanisms in GBM through an       integrated approach combining network toxicology, single-cell transcriptomics,       Mendelian randomization, and bibliometric analysis. BaP target genes       were predicted using ChEMBL, SEA, and PharmMapper, and GBM-related genes were       retrieved from GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD. Overlapping genes were used to construct       a protein-protein interaction network in Cytoscape. Molecular docking and       molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess BaP-target interactions.       Single-cell RNA-seq data (GSE131928) were analyzed to profile gene expression in       GBM subpopulations. Mendelian randomization assessed causal relationships between       core genes and GBM risk, and findings were validated in vitro. Bibliometric       analysis tracked research trends on these genes. 31 overlapping genes       were identified. TP53 was highly expressed in MES-like and AC-like malignant       cells as well as CD8⁺ Tex cells. MR revealed a significant inverse association       between TP53 expression and GBM risk (OR = 0.13, 95 % 0.04-0.47, p = 0.002).       Docking and simulation showed strong BaP-TP53 binding, confirmed by in vitro       experiments. Bibliometrics indicated that TP53 research in GBM has shifted from       basic mechanisms to clinical translation. BaP may drive GBM by       targeting TP53, offering insights for GBM prevention and therapy.	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	01/10/2025

Budde LE, Zhang H, Kim WS, Maruyama D, Rego EM, Norasetthada L, Hong H, Ozcan M, Jeon YW, Cordeiro de Farias DL, Fogliatto LM, Pavlovsky A, Goto H, Olszewski AJ, Shah N, Hu B, Yin S, Wu H, To I, Ead WS, Ashby J, Janousek M, Pham S, Wang J, Kwan A, Batlevi CL, Wei MC, Westin J	Prognosis for patients with refractory/relapsed large B-cell lymphoma       (LBCL) considered ineligible for curative-intent therapy is poor. The combination       of mosunetuzumab, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody, and polatuzumab vedotin,       an antibody-drug conjugate, (Mosun-Pola), represents a novel fixed-duration       outpatient therapy. In the phase 3 SUNMO trial, patients with       refractory/relapsed LBCL who were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant       were randomized (2:1) to receive Mosun-Pola or rituximab, gemcitabine, and       oxaliplatin (R-GemOx). Dual primary endpoints were centrally-assessed overall       response rate and progression-free survival. Overall survival was a key secondary       endpoint. A total of 208 patients were randomized to receive Mosun-Pola       (n=138) or R-GemOx (n=70). At a median follow-up of 23.2 months, the primary       analysis of SUNMO demonstrated that the median progression-free survival was       significantly longer with Mosun-Pola than with R-GemOx(11.5 months [95%       confidence interval (CI), 5.6-18] vs 3.8 months [95% CI, 2.9-4.1]; hazard ratio       for progression or death, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.3-0.6]; P<0.0001). Overall response       rate was significantly greater with Mosun-Pola versus R-GemOx (70% vs 40%;       P<0.0001), with a complete response rate of 51% and 24%, respectively. In the       Mosun-Pola group, the rate of grade ≥2 cytokine release syndrome and usage of       tocilizumab occurred in less than 5% of patients, and patient-reported outcomes       were improved compared with R-GemOx. Mosun-Pola demonstrated superior       efficacy verus R-GemOx, with significant improvements in both overall response       rate and progression-free survival, and infrequent cytokine release syndrome       events with a manageable safety profile.(Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd;       ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05171647).	Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of	02/10/2025
10.2174/1874609809666151124233206	Anesthesia Issues in Central Nervous System Disorders.	Mandal PK, Saharan S, Penna O, Fodale V	Every year, millions of people affected by disorders of the central nervous       system (CNS) undergo various diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical procedures       requiring administration of anesthetic agents. Anesthetics exert their       anesthetic, amnesic and analgesic effects by acting on multiple neuronal membrane       proteins in the CNS. While some of the causal anesthetic targets have been       identified, a large number of anesthetic targets remain unknown. The consequent       longterm effect of anesthetic agents on expression of these various molecular       targets has been implicated in mediating potentially long-lasting adverse       effects. Recent work suggested that the effects of general anesthetics may not be       entirely reversible, with animal studies demonstrating persistent changes in CNS       protein expression post recovery from anesthesia. Age-associated or       disease-induced alterations in the CNS can profoundly alter multiple aspects of       brain structure, biochemistry, and function. Such maladaptive changes in the       brain can render it increasingly vulnerable to the effects of various       anesthetics. The selection of appropriate anesthesia drugs and protocol is       mandatory, especially in individuals with pre-existing CNS disorders, so as to       maximize anesthesia efficiency, avoid occurrence of adverse events, and ensure       patient safety. This review aims to summarize and consider the effects and       potential risks of commonly used anesthetic agents in patients with compromised       CNS function. We provide a comprehensive review of the established as well as the       implicated effects of anesthetic agents on the elderly as well as on the       pathology and progression of common neurological conditions.

Proteomics offers a       crucial approach to elucidating AD pathogenesis, as alterations in protein       expression are more directly linked to phenotypic outcomes than changes at the       genetic or transcriptomic level. In this study, we develop multiscale proteomic       network models for AD by integrating large-scale matched proteomic and genetic       data from brain regions vulnerable to the disease. These models reveal detailed       protein interaction structures and identify putative key driver proteins (KDPs)       involved in AD progression. Notably, the network analysis uncovers an       AD-associated subnetwork that captures glia-neuron interactions. AHNAK, a top KDP       in this glia-neuron network, is experimentally validated in human induced       pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models of AD. This systematic identification       of dysregulated protein regulatory networks and KDPs lays down a foundation for       developing innovative therapeutic strategies for AD.	Cell	25/09/2025
10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00268-8	Disease relapse, all-cause mortality, and adverse events associated with       long-acting injectable antipsychotics versus oral antipsychotics in older people       with schizophrenia in Hong Kong: a population-based within-subject analysis.	Wei Y, Yan VKC, Castle DJ, Huang C, Deng EK, Leung SM, Yiu HHE, Lee KJ, Lui SSY, Ng VWS, Hayes JF, Lai FTT, Wang H, Yan EWC, Chan EW	Older individuals (aged ≥65 years) with schizophrenia are at       increased risk of treatment non-adherence due to cognitive decline and complex       polypharmacy. Use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics in this       population has not been systematically investigated. We aimed to compare risk of       disease relapse, all-cause mortality, and adverse events associated with LAI       versus oral antipsychotics among older people with schizophrenia. In       this population-based within-subject analysis, we used territory-wide electronic       health records from the Clinical Database Analysis and Reporting System of the       Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM       code 295) in inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department settings between Jan       1, 1993, and Dec 31, 2023, were identified, and people aged 65 years and older       who were prescribed LAI or oral antipsychotics between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31,       2023, were considered for inclusion. Individuals with incomplete demographic       information were excluded. The primary outcome was disease relapse, defined as       hospital admission for schizophrenia. The secondary outcomes comprised all-cause       mortality and adverse events, including cardiovascular hospital admission,       extrapyramidal symptoms, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury, which were       identified using ICD-9-CM codes or laboratory tests. A self-controlled case       series study using Poisson regression was conducted to compare the risk of       disease relapse and adverse events between the treatment periods of LAI and oral       antipsychotics. An individual-stratified Cox regression was performed for       all-cause mortality. Time-varying confounders, including age, season, class of       antipsychotics, COVID-19 stringency index, and concomitant treatment with       antidepressants, benzodiazepines or Z-drugs, mood stabilisers, and       antiparkinsonian drugs, were adjusted for. People with lived experience of       schizophrenia were not involved in the design or conduct of the study. Of 24 985 older individuals with schizophrenia, 4696 (18·8%) were prescribed LAI       or oral antipsychotics. 10 655 (42·6%) of 24 985 individuals were male and 14 330       (57·4%) were female. Data on ethnicity were not available. Compared with oral       antipsychotics, LAI antipsychotics were associated with statistically       significantly lower risk of hospital admission for schizophrenia (incidence rate       ratio [IRR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·64-0·78], p<0·0001) and all-cause mortality (hazard       ratio [HR] 0·23 [95% CI 0·12-0·44], p<0·0001). No statistically significant       difference was found in cardiovascular hospital admissions, acute liver injury,       and acute kidney injury. LAI antipsychotics were associated with increased risk       of extrapyramidal symptoms (IRR 2·17 [1·24-3·80], p=0·0068), but only with       first-generation (2·86 [1·41-5·84], p=0·0038) not second-generation LAI       antipsychotics. In older individuals with schizophrenia, LAI       antipsychotics were associated with lower risk of disease relapse and mortality,       without increased risk of adverse events, than oral antipsychotics, except for       elevated risk of extrapyramidal symptoms specifically related to first-generation       LAI antipsychotics. Overall, LAI antipsychotics, especially second-generation       medications, could be more broadly considered for long-term use among this       population, particularly at an early stage of disease.

10.1038/s41556-025-01773-z	Microtubule architecture connects AMOT stability to YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction       and Hippo signalling.	Vanni G, Citron A, Suli A, Contessotto P, Caire R, Gandin A, Mantovan G, Zanconato F, Brusatin G, Di Palma M, Peirano E, Pozzer LS, Albanese C Jr, Steiner RA, Cordenonsi M, Panciera T, Piccolo S	Cellular mechanotransduction is a key informational system, yet its mechanisms       remain elusive. Here we unveil the role of microtubules in mechanosignalling,       operating downstream of subnuclear F-actin and nuclear envelope mechanics. Upon       mechanical activation, microtubules reorganize from a perinuclear cage into a       radial array nucleated by centrosomes. This structural rearrangement triggers       degradation of AMOT proteins, which we identify as key mechanical rheostats that       sequester YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm. AMOT is stable in mechano-OFF but degraded in       mechano-ON cell states, where microtubules allow AMOT rapid transport to the       pericentrosomal proteasome in complex with dynein/dynactin. This process ensures       swift control of YAP/TAZ function in response to changes in cell mechanics, with       experimental loss of AMOT proteins rendering cells insensitive to mechanical       modulations. Ras/RTK oncogenes promote YAP/TAZ-dependent tumorigenesis by       corrupting this AMOT-centred mechanical checkpoint. Notably, the Hippo pathway       fine-tunes mechanotransduction: LATS kinases phosphorylate AMOT, shielding it       from degradation, thereby indirectly restraining YAP/TAZ. Thus, AMOT protein       stability serves as a hub linking cytoskeletal reorganization and Hippo       signalling to YAP/TAZ mechanosignalling.	Nature cell biology	01/10/2025
10.1186/s12974-025-03561-w	NLRP3 inflammasome and hearing loss: from mechanisms to therapies.	Murillo-Cuesta S, Seoane E, Cervantes B, Zubeldia JM, Varela-Nieto I	The NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, has emerged       as a central mediator of inflammation-driven sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).       This review synthesizes current evidence on its involvement across a wide       spectrum of auditory pathologies, including genetic syndromes such as CAPS and       autosomal dominant deafness (DFNA) 34, as well as noise-induced, age-related,       drug-induced, and viral hearing loss. Dysregulated activation of NLRP3 in the       cochlea leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1B and IL-18) and       pyroptotic cell death, contributing to irreversible cochlear damage. Experimental       studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 via agents       such as MCC950, oridonin and tranylcypromine can preserve auditory function.       Gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene are frequently associated with both       syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss, and animal models expressing these       mutations replicate cochlear inflammation and hearing deficits, validating their       pathogenic role. Clinically, IL-1B signaling blockers such as anakinra and       canakinumab have shown efficacy in CAPS patients, stabilizing or improving       hearing outcomes. Emerging selective NLRP3 inhibitors, including dapansutrilo and       MCC950, are progressing through early-phase clinical trials. Additionally,       natural compounds such as piceatannol and oridonin have demonstrated       otoprotective effects in preclinical models of noise- and drug-induced hearing       loss. Collectively, these findings position the NLRP3 inflammasome as a promising       therapeutic target for SNHL. Future translational research should focus on       validating NLRP3-targeting compounds in human trials, identifying biomarkers for       early diagnosis, and exploring combination therapies that integrate       anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and regenerative strategies. Targeting NLRP3 may       ultimately redefine treatment paradigms for preventing or halting progressive       hearing loss.	Journal of neuroinflammation	04/10/2025
10.2196/jmir.6759	Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity: Study and Implications.	Althoff T, White RW, Horvitz E	Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces       the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely       recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get       recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found       to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive       populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due       to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent       and salient example of such a game is Pokémon Go, which has reportedly reached       tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. The       objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical       activity. We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical activity through       a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and       search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months.       Pokémon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical       activity is measured through accelerometers. We find that Pokémon       Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days,       with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for       details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on       average, a more than 25% increase compared with their prior activity level       (P<.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokémon Go has       added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon       Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages,       weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to       increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health.       In particular, we find that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations,       whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from       an already very active population. Mobile apps combining game play       with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in       contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the       potential to reach activity-poor populations.

Here, we demonstrate the presence of       pseudo-synaptic connections between sensory nerve endings and cancer cells in an       extracerebral cancer, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These       synaptic sites exhibit a selective enrichment of the glutamatergic       N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2D (GRIN2D) on the       cancer cells, which turns PDAC cells responsive to neuron-derived glutamate and       promotes tumor growth and spread. Intriguingly, neurons transform a subset of       co-cultured PDAC cells into calcium-responsive cells via GRIN2D-type glutamate       receptors at the neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses. We found that the expression of       this subunit is due to the increased glutamate availability provided by sensory       innervation in a neurotrophic feedforward loop. Moreover, interference with the       glutamate-GRIN2D signaling at these neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses markedly       improved survival in vivo. This discovery of peripheral cancer-neuron       pseudo-synapses may provide an opportunity for cancer-neuroscience-instructed       oncological therapies.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025

Asao T, Saida Y, Watanabe S, Kisohara A, Kishi K, Morita R, Nakagawa T, Tsukita Y, Furuya N, Miyawaki T, Ishikawa N, Yamada T, Tanaka T, Morita S, Kikuchi T, Maemondo M, Kobayashi K	Treating patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)       with poor performance status poses considerable challenges. We aimed to evaluate       the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based therapy in       this population. This open-label, single-arm phase 2 NEJ045A trial       enrolled untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC with performance status 2       or 3. Participants received four cycles of durvalumab, carboplatin, and       etoposide, followed by durvalumab maintenance. A dose adjustment strategy was       used, with initial reductions in carboplatin-etoposide dosages, subsequently       adjusted based on adverse events, allowing for potential escalation. The primary       endpoint was tolerability, assessed by the proportion of patients completing       induction therapy. A key secondary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. This trial       is registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031200319) and has       been completed. Between April 8, 2021, and Oct 3, 2023, 57 patients       (performance status 2 n=43 and performance status 3 n=14) were enrolled with a       median age of 73·5 years (IQR 69·0-77·5), 44 (79%) of 56 were male. 26 (67%; 80%       CI 55·2-76·7; p<0·0001) of 39 patients with performance status 2 and five (50%;       26·7-73·3; p=0·0088) of ten with performance status 3 completed induction       therapy, exceeding the pre-specified threshold. Grade 3 or higher adverse events       occurred in 52 (93%) of 56 patients, and 12 (21%) of 56 discontinued due to       adverse events. The 1-year survival rates were 43·4% (80% CI 34·1-53·1) overall       (p<0·0001), 50·0% (39·1-60·9) in performance status 2 (p<0·0001), and 18·2%       (5·0-41·5) in performance status 3. Durvalumab, carboplatin, and       etoposide showed tolerability and promising efficacy as a first-line treatment       for patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC with poor performance status,       supporting the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this       therapeutically challenging population.

10.1016/j.chom.2025.09.009	Immunometabolic reprogramming of macrophages by gut microbiota-derived cadaverine       controls colon inflammation.	de Oliveira Formiga R, Li Q, Zhao Y, Campos Ribeiro MA, Guarino-Vignon P, Fatouh R, Dubois L, Creusot L, Puchois V, Amouyal S, Alonso Salgueiro I, Bredon M, Chollet L, Ledent T, Scandola C, Auger JP, Danne C, Krönke G, Tkacz E, Emond P, Chevreux G, Pham HP, Pontoizeau C, Lamaziere A, Argüello RJ, Rolhion N, Michel ML, Wai T, Sokol H	Cadaverine is a polyamine produced by the gut microbiota with links to health and       disease, notably inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we show that cadaverine       shapes monocyte-macrophage immunometabolism in a context- and       concentration-dependent fashion to impact macrophage functionality. At baseline,       cadaverine is taken up via L-lysine transporters and activates the thioredoxin       system, while during inflammation, cadaverine signals through aconitate       decarboxylase 1 (Acod1)-itaconate. Both pathways induce activation of       transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which       supports mitochondrial respiration and promotes immunoregulatory macrophage       polarization. Conversely, under higher concentrations, cadaverine acts via       histamine 4 receptor, leading to glycolysis-driven inflammation and       pro-inflammatory functions in macrophages. Likewise, cadaverine exhibits       paradoxical effects in experimental colitis, either protective or detrimental,       evoking opposite fates on macrophages depending on levels dictated by       Enterobacteriaceae. In IBD patients, elevated cadaverine correlated with higher       flare risk. Our findings implicate cadaverine as a microbiota-derived metabolite       manipulating macrophage energy metabolism with consequences in intestinal       inflammation and implications for IBD pathogenesis.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1666884	Neutrophil-to-albumin ratio: a novel predictor of osteoporosis in rheumatoid       arthritis.	Zhang Y, He Z, Li K, Wu Q, Wang S, Liu M, Liu Q, Xu Q, Kong X, Lin C	Osteoporosis (OP) frequently coexists with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),       but validated predictors of early risk are not extensively studied. This study       seeks to examine the relationship between the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin       ratio (NPAR) and the likelihood of developing RA-related OP(RA-OP). After investigating the relationship between the NPAR and RA-OP in the clinical       retrospective study, we further validated this association using data from the       National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2005-2020       cycles). This retrospective study enrolled 718 RA patients from the Rheumatology       Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese       Medicine between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients were categorized into       low-NPAR (<1.7598) and high-NPAR (≥1.7598) groups based on the median NPAR.       Extracted clinical data encompassed demographic characteristics, comorbidities,       serological markers, and other laboratory parameters. Preliminary univariate and       multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed potential associations between       NPAR and RA-OP, multi-model adjusted logistic regression was subsequently applied       to evaluate the independent association, subgroup analyses examined consistency       across demographic and clinical strata, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)       curve analysis assessed NPAR's diagnostic performance, and then Restricted cubic       splines (RCS) visualized potential non-linear relationships. Finally using the       identical statistical framework, we validated findings within the NHANES cohort.       The high-NPAR group exhibited significantly higher OP incidence than the       low-NPAR group (39.0% vs. 26.5%; P<0.001). After full adjustment (Model 4), NPAR       remained independently associated with increased RA-OP risk as a categorical       variable (high vs. low adjusted OR = 1.70 (95%1.01~2.88); P = 0.049).       Subgroup analyses demonstrated no significant interaction effects       (P-interaction>0.05) except for disease duration. The ROC curve showed an Area       Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.58 (95%0.53~0.63) and NPAR cut-off of 1.886. The       covariate-adjusted RCS indicated a linear dose-response relationship (P       overall=0.033; P nonlinearity=0.168). NHANES cohort analysis independently       validated both the NPAR-RA-OP association and its linear characteristic.       NPAR, serving as a novel composite biomarker integrating       neutrophil-mediated inflammation and nutritional status (via albumin),       independently predicts OP risk in RA. Its derivation from routine clinical       parameters renders NPAR a readily deployable, cost-effective tool for OP risk       stratification in clinical practice.	Frontiers in immunology	01/01/2025
10.1038/s41551-025-01525-2	Targeted clearance of extracellular Tau using aptamer-armed monocytes alleviates       neuroinflammation in mice with Alzheimer's disease.	Zhuo Y, Lu Y, Zhu Y, Wen N, Zou G, Lu H, Pei X, Zhang Y, Zhang Q, Wang X, Zhang W, Zhang Q, Wang Z, Xie S, Li CQ, Tan W, Qiu L	Extracellular Tau determines the progression of Alzheimer's disease, yet       therapeutic strategies targeting it are hindered by poor brain delivery and       limited clearance. Here we developed a Tau-clearing cell therapy based on       monocytes functionalized with a high-affinity Tau-specific aptamer. The aptamer       was covalently conjugated to the surface of monocytes (derived from bone marrow       leucocytes and cultured under monocyte-inducing conditions) via bioorthogonal       chemistry without affecting their viability or function. Upon intravenous       administration in mice expressing mutant and disease-relevant human Tau, the       engineered monocytes actively crossed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in       Tau-rich brain regions such as the hippocampus and striatum. They efficiently       phagocytosed extracellular Tau, leading to a significant reduction in Tau burden.       As a result, glial activation was suppressed, neuroinflammation was alleviated,       and neuronal and mitochondrial integrity was preserved. Long-term treatment       improved memory and spatial learning, without inducing toxicity or behavioural       side effects. These results demonstrate that aptamer-guided monocytes can achieve       targeted delivery, effective clearance and sustained neuroprotection, offering a       promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

10.1002/oby.70058	Reasons for Discontinuation of Obesity Pharmacotherapy With Semaglutide or       Tirzepatide in Clinical Practice.	Gasoyan H, Butsch WS, Casacchia NJ, Schulte R, Criswell V, Fox J, Renner H, Le P, Alpert J, Rothberg MB	This study aimed to characterize the reasons for treatment       discontinuation with injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity in regular       clinical practice. This cross-sectional study used electronic health       record data between January 2022 and December 2024 from a single integrated       health system in Ohio and Florida. The primary reason for treatment       discontinuation was examined in a randomly selected sample of adults with       overweight or obesity and without type 2 diabetes who initiated injectable       semaglutide or tirzepatide and discontinued treatment within the first year.       We randomly selected 288 patients; 145 received semaglutide and 143       tirzepatide. Overall, 137 patients (47.6%) discontinued their medication due to       cost or insurance-related issues, 42 (14.6%) due to inability to tolerate the       side effects, 34 (11.8%) as they were unable to fill the medication due to       shortages, 7 (2.4%) as they switched to a compounded medication, and 5 (1.7%) due       to unsatisfactory weight loss; 31 (10.8%) discontinued for other reasons, and for       32 (11.1%) patients the discontinuation reason was not specified in the       electronic health record. High cost or insurance-related issues are       the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation with semaglutide or       tirzepatide for obesity. Our findings highlight the need for policies to address       cost and could inform discussions between healthcare providers and patients       concerning cost and side effects.

10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.06.019	Ultraprocessed foods consumption, inflammatory index levels, and risk of suicide       attempt: findings from a prospective cohort study.	Wu Y, Sun M, Yuan Y, Zhang S, Zhu L, Lou Z, Shi Y, Li J, Sun Z, Yang L, Li L, Shen Y	Suicide attempts (SAs) are a major public health issue, with many       cases being preventable. However, the impact of dietary patterns remains       inadequately studied. Currently, the rising consumption of ultraprocessed foods       (UPFs) has been linked to various health issues, including mental health       disorders that may increase risk of SA. This study aimed to       investigate the association between UPF consumption and SA, and explore the       mediating role of SA-related inflammatory index levels. This study       included 208,938 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, recruited from 2006 to       2010. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between       the weight proportion of UPF intake and incident SA. Substitution analyses were       conducted to evaluate risk of SA when replacing UPF with unprocessed or minimally       processed foods (UNPFs). Causal mediation analyses were further conducted to       estimate the mediating effects of inflammatory index levels in this association.       Over a median follow-up of 13.1 y, 545 SA events were identified.       Compared with participants in the lowest quintile of UPF consumption, those in       the highest quintile had a 1.63 times higher risk of developing SA [hazard ratio       (HR): 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.15]. Additionally, each SD       increase in UPF consumption was associated with a 20% higher risk of SA (1.20, 95% 1.11, 1.29). Notably, replacing 20% of UPF weight with UNPF was       linked to a 23% reduction in SA risk (0.77, 95% 0.69, 0.85). Furthermore,       in causal mediation analyses, inflammatory index levels mediated 0.7%-1.5% of the       association between UPF consumption and SA. Higher UPF consumption       is associated with an increased risk of SA, partially mediated by inflammatory       index levels. Replacing UPF with UNPF significantly reduces SA incidence,       highlighting potential benefits of transitioning to a diet with higher UNPF       consumption.

10.1016/j.devcel.2025.09.009	TMK-PIN1 drives a short self-organizing circuit for auxin export and signaling in       Arabidopsis.	Huang R, Wang J, Chang M, Tang W, Yu Y, Zhang Y, Peng Y, Wang Y, Guo Y, Lu T, Cao Y, Zhou Y, Zhang Q, Huang Y, Wu A, Ren L, Gallei M, Dong J, Chen H, He J, Wen M, Friml J, Sun L, Xiong Y, Yang Z, Xu T	The versatile and pivotal roles of the phytohormone auxin in regulating plant       growth and development are typically linked to its directional transport, relying       on the polarized PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters at the plasma membrane (PM).       For decades, auxin has been proposed to promote PIN polarization, generating       self-regulatory feedback mediating much of plant development, but mechanistic       insight into this regulation is lacking. Here, we uncover an auxin-induced       protein complex at the PM, containing auxin co-receptors transmembrane kinases       (TMKs) and PIN1 auxin exporter, as the core machinery that underlies this       feedback regulation. Auxin promotes PIN1 phosphorylation by TMKs, modulating PIN1       polarization and transport activity. We also provide evidence that PIN1-exported       extracellular auxin is crucial for TMK activation and cell elongation, thus       forming the simplest two-element self-regulatory feedback circuit. Thus, these       findings offer direct mechanistic insights into a potential self-organizing       circuit for auxin signaling and transport to ensure proper plant development in       Arabidopsis.

10.1101/gad.8.10.1174	The DCC gene product in cellular differentiation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	Hedrick L, Cho KR, Fearon ER, Wu TC, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B	The analysis of human colorectal tumors has revealed frequent loss of       heterozygosity (LOH) of the long arm of chromosome 18. A novel gene, DCC (deleted       in colorectal cancer), located within the region of LOH on chromosome 18q was       identified and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene. We have now shown       that DCC encodes a membrane-bound protein of the immunoglobulin-CAM family, as       demonstrated by cell-surface labeling, immunohistochemical analysis, and       sequencing of cDNA clones. The DCC protein was found in axons of the central and       peripheral nervous system and in differentiated cell types of the intestine.       Colorectal tumors that lost their capacity to differentiate into mucus producing       cells uniformly lacked DCC expression and loss of a chromosome 18q allele was       often accompanied by loss of DCC expression in colon tumors. These results       provide evidence that DCC encodes a cell surface-localized protein and emphasize       the inverse relationship between differentiation and tumorigenesis.

Tan S, Ming Y, Guo J, Liu W, Ma H, Liu Y, Xu Z, Gu-Ha AL, Dai L, Lin YD, Peng Y	"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive       malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While circular RNAs       (circRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in ESCC, their functional roles and       molecular mechanisms in tumor progression remain largely unexplored. We       characterized circRNA using RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescent in situ       hybridization. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo were       performed to assess circRNA function. Molecular interactions were investigated       via RNA pull-down assays coupled with mass spectrometry, electrophoretic mobility       shift assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis. Clinical relevance       was evaluated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in patient specimens. We identified circLNF, a novel circRNA derived from the long non-coding RNA FIRRE       gene, which is significantly upregulated in ESCC. Functional assays demonstrated       that circLNF promotes proliferative and migratory capacities in cultured cells       and accelerates tumor progression and metastasis in animal models.       Mechanistically, circLNF directly interacts with IGF2BP family proteins through       their ""CAUC"" motifs, protecting them from TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and       proteasomal degradation. Importantly, circLNF expression positively correlated       with IGF2BP1 protein levels in ESCC patient tissues, underscoring the clinical       relevance of the circLNF-IGF2BP axis in ESCC progression. Our       findings reveal an oncogenic role of circLNF in ESCC by inhibiting       TRIM25-mediated proteasomal degradation of IGF2BP proteins and highlight circLNF       as a potential therapeutic target for ESCC."

The genetic factors contributing to susceptibility across different       populations and tumour subsites remain incompletely understood. Here we show,       through a genome-wide association and fine mapping study of over 19,000 HNSCC       cases and 38,000 controls from multiple ancestries, 18 genetic risk variants and       11 signals from fine mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, all       previously unreported. rs78378222, a regulatory variant for TP53 is associated       with a 40% reduction in overall HNSCC risk. We also identify gene-environment       interactions, with BRCA2 and ADH1B variants showing effects modified by smoking       and alcohol use. Subsite-specific analysis of the HLA region reveals distinct       immune-related associations across HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours.

Culviner PH, Frey AM, Liu Q, Ha DTM, Thai PVK, Thu DDA, Quang NL, Calderon R, Lecca L, Caws M, Dunstan SJ, Murray MB, Thuong NTT, Fortune SM	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has co-evolved with humans for thousands of       years and is characterized by variation in virulence, transmissibility, and       disease phenotypes. To identify bacterial contributors to phenotypic diversity,       we developed new RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and phylogenomic tools to capture       hundreds of Mtb isolate transcriptomes, link transcriptional and genetic       variation, and find associations between variants and epidemiologic traits.       Across 274 Mtb clinical isolates, we uncovered unexpected diversity in virulence       gene expression, which we linked to known and unknown regulators. Surprisingly,       we found that many isolates harbor variants associated with decreased expression       of EsxA (Esat6) and EsxB (Cfp10), which are virulence effectors, dominant T cell       antigens, and immunodiagnostic targets. Across >55,000 isolates, these variants       associate with increased transmissibility, especially in drug-resistant Mtb       strains. Our data suggest expression of Mtb virulence genes is evolving in       response to drug-linked pressure, raising concerns about use of these targets in       immunodiagnostics and next-generation vaccines.

10.1038/s41586-025-09557-z	The Panoptes system uses decoy cyclic nucleotides to defend against phage.	Sullivan AE, Nabhani A, Izrailevsky DS, Schinkel K, Hoffman CRK, Robbins LK, Nagy TA, Duncan ML, Ledvina HE, Erbse AH, Kibby EM, Tak U, Dinh DM, Ednacot EMQ, Nguyen CM, Burroughs AM, Aravind L, Whiteley AT, Morehouse BR	Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate       nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector       proteins to mediate immunity(1). Phages respond with counter-defences that       deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the       host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly       detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived       second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE, wherein OptS is       predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is       predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal       structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a       version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS       orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide       products, including 2',3'-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2',3'-c-di-AMP),       which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane       effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had       loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage       signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were       unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide 'sponge' that antagonizes       second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide       sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane       disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated       immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn       immune evasion against the virus.	Nature	01/10/2025

CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 6 (CMTM6)       stabilizes PD-L1 surface expression and modulates tumor immunity in solid cancer.       In this study, we found a role for FLT3-induced CMTM6 in hematological       malignancies. FLT3 drove CMTM6 and PD-L1 expression in AML cells, while FLT3       inhibition reduced expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1. In three distinct allogeneic       hematopoietic cell transplantation mouse models, transplantation of Cmtm6       deficient FLT3-ITD+ leukemia cells resulted in prolonged survival, reduced       leukemia burden, enhanced T cell effector function, and decreased expression of T       cell exhaustion markers compared to Cmtm6 proficient FLT3-ITD+ leukemia cells.       Furthermore, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 and tandutinib significantly       improved survival, suppressed leukemia cell expansion, and augmented the       anti-leukemia T cell response in mice bearing FLT3-ITD+ leukemia.       Mechanistically, protein-protein interaction of FLT3 and CMTM6 within their       transmembrane domains, which was not phosphorylation dependent, enhanced CMTM6       stability in leukemia cells, while FLT3-ITD did not increase CMTM6 and PD-L1       expression at the RNA level. Furthermore, CMTM6 upregulation and protein       interaction with FLT3 was validated in primary leukemia cells from two       independent cohorts of patients with FLT3-ITD+ AML. Collectively, these findings       uncover FLT3-mediated stabilization of CMTM6 in AML cells, which results in       enhanced PD-L1 cell surface expression and leukemia immune escape.

10.3892/ijmm.2025.5651	The gut‑skin axis: Emerging insights in understanding and treating skin diseases       through gut microbiome modulation (Review).	Zhao Y, Yu C, Zhang J, Yao Q, Zhu X, Zhou X	Emerging evidence indicates a significant association between the composition and       functionality of the gut microbiome and various skin disorders, including       psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne and several dermatological conditions. The       gut‑skin axis theory describes a complex bidirectional communication network       between the gut and the skin, providing mechanistic insights into the       pathogenesis of certain cutaneous diseases. Specifically, the gut microbiome       influences skin health through the regulation of systemic immunity, inflammatory       responses and metabolic pathways. Advances in high‑throughput sequencing and       bioinformatics technologies have substantially enhanced the understanding of the       role of the gut microbiome in skin pathology. Clinical and preclinical studies       have demonstrated that restoring gut microbial homeostasis via interventions such       as faecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics and prebiotics can ameliorate       symptoms of skin diseases. Furthermore, personalized microbiome‑based therapies,       next‑generation probiotics and dietary modifications hold promise for refining       gut‑skin interactions and advancing precision medicine in dermatology.       Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut‑skin axis offer novel avenues for       innovative dermatological treatments, with future breakthroughs potentially       involving microbial community engineering, postbiotics and artificial       intelligence in microbiome‑related diagnostics. This narrative review summarizes       recent advances in gut‑skin axis research, explores its potential in the       prevention and management of selected dermatoses and discusses future trends and       scientific developments in the field.

10.1172/JCI190017	Targeting specific kinase substrates rescues increased colitis severity induced       by the Crohn's disease-linked LRRK2-N2081D variant.	Heaton GR, Li X, Li X, Zhou X, Zhang Y, Vu DT, Oeller M, Karayel O, Hoang QQ, Kars ME, Kamath N, Wang M, Tarassishin L, Mann M, Peter I, Yue Z	LRRK2 contains a kinase domain where the N2081D Crohn's disease (CD) risk and the       G2019S Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenic variants are located. It is not clear       how the N2081D variant increases CD risk or how these adjacent mutations give       rise to distinct disorders. To investigate the pathophysiology of the CD-linked       LRRK2 N2081D variant, we generated a knock-in (KI) mouse model and compared its       effects with those of the LRRK2-G2019S mutation. Lrrk2N2081D KI mice demonstrated       heightened sensitivity to induced colitis, resulting in more severe intestinal       damage than in Lrrk2G2019S KI and WT mice. Analysis of colon tissue revealed       distinct mutation-dependent LRRK2 RAB substrate phosphorylation, with       significantly elevated phosphorylated RAB10 levels in Lrrk2N2081D mice. In cells,       we demonstrated that the N2081D mutation activates LRRK2 through a mechanism       distinct from that of LRRK2-G2019S. We also found that proinflammatory       stimulation enhances LRRK2 kinase activity, leading to mutation-dependent       differences in RAB phosphorylation and inflammatory responses in dendritic cells       (DCs). Finally, we show that knockout of Rab12, but not pharmacological LRRK2       kinase inhibition, significantly reduced colitis severity in Lrrk2N2081D mice.       Our study characterizes the pathogenic mechanisms of LRRK2-linked CD, highlights       structural and functional differences between disease-associated LRRK2 variants,       and suggests RAB proteins as promising therapeutic targets for modulating LRRK2       activity in CD treatment.

10.1038/s41564-025-02142-0	Discovery and artificial intelligence-guided mechanistic elucidation of a       narrow-spectrum antibiotic.	Catacutan DB, Tran V, Arnold A, Alexander J, Corso G, Yousefi Y, Tu MM, McLellan S, Tertigas D, Magolan J, Surette MG, Brown ED, Coombes BK, Barzilay R, Stokes JM	Current clinical antibiotics are largely broad-spectrum agents that can alter the       gut microbiome and promote colonization by Enterobacteriaceae, which are often       drug resistant. This includes adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC),       particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, in which dysbiosis       creates a niche for this pathogen to colonize. There is an urgent and unmet need       for novel narrow-spectrum and microbiome-sparing antibiotics. Here we screened       10,747 bioactive small molecules for antibacterial activity against AIEC and       discovered enterololin, an antibacterial compound with targeted activity against       Enterobacteriaceae species. Enterololin could overcome intrinsic and acquired       resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates when combined with a subinhibitory       concentration of SPR741, a polymyxin B analogue used here to increase outer       membrane permeability in Gram-negative bacteria. Molecular substructure- and deep       learning-guided mechanism-of-action investigations revealed that enterololin       perturbs lipoprotein trafficking through a mechanism involving the LolCDE       complex, laboratory-evolved resistant mutants predominantly mapped to lolC and       lolE, with an in vitro frequency of resistance of ~10(-8) to 10(-7). Enterololin       showed low mammalian cytotoxicity (HEK293 half-maximal inhibitory concentration       ~100 µg ml(-1)) and suppressed AIEC infection in mouse models when administered       in combination with SPR741, while largely preserving the overall microbiome       composition. This study highlights the utility of deep learning methods for       predicting molecular interactions and identifies a promising       Enterobacteriaceae-specific antibacterial candidate for further development.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1635757	Efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced squamous       non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.	Liu N, Zhang B, He J, Li S	Significant efficacy heterogeneity exists between first- and       second-line immunotherapy regimens for advanced squamous non-small cell lung       cancer (SqNSCLC), but most regimens lack directly comparable clinical trial       evidence, resulting in unclear prioritization. This analysis identifies optimal       treatment strategies by evaluating differences in efficacy across immune       checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We search through comprehensive databases,       including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the Clinical Trials Database.       Traditional meta-analysis was done using Stata 15.0, while Bayesian-framework       network meta-analysis was implemented with R's GEMTC package via Markov chain       Monte Carlo simulation. Subgroup analyses were performed for different PD-L1       expression levels, number of treatments, ethnic groups, and smoking history.       We included 25 randomized controlled trials. Immune-related therapy can       provide significant benefit relative to chemotherapy alone in advanced SqNSCLC.       Compared with chemotherapy, except for ipilimumab+chemo [HR = 0.92,95%(0.59-1.40)], atezolizumab+chemo [HR = 0.88, 95%(0.56-1.40)], and       durvalumab+chemo [HR = 0.84, 95% (0.52-1.40)], durvalumab+ tremelimumab+chemo       [HR = 0. 88, 95% (0.54-1.40)], which significantly improved overall       survival(OS). Cemiplimab [HR = 0.48, 95% (0.34-0.67)] showed the best OS       benefit. Compared with chemotherapy, all immunotherapies significantly improved       progression-free survival (PFS) except for ipilimumab+chemo [HR = 0.87, 95% (0.75-1.00)]. Sugemalimab+chemo provided the best survival benefit [HR = 0.34,       95% (0.24-0.48)]. For PD-L1≥50% tumors, penpulimab showed excellent OS and       PFS; for PD-L1 1-49% tumors, pembrolizumab+chemo and camrelizumab+chemo achieved       the best OS and PFS, respectively; for PD-L1≥1% tumors, the tislelizumab+chemo       and camrelizumab+chemo showed the best OS and PFS results, while for tumors with       PD-L1 <1%, both nivolumab and serplulimab+chemo provided significant survival       benefit. In Asian patients, patients treated with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab       + chemotherapy had favorable OS and PFS benefits. In non-Asian patients, there       was also favorable OS and PFS benefit with cemiplimab. For former/current       smokers, pembrolizumab+chemotherapy and camrelizumab+chemotherapy had significant       OS and PFS benefit, but most immunotherapies did not improve OS and PFS in never       smokers. Camrelizumab+chemo [OR = 3.5, 95% (2.3-5.3)] had the best overall       response rate (ORR) benefit. Ipilimumab+chemo had the highest incidence of       adverse events (AEs) [OR = 2.0, 95% (1.5-2.7)]. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD420251027447.

10.1016/j.jchf.2025.102660	Semaglutide and Exercise Function in Obesity-Related HFpEF: Insights From the       STEP-HFpEF Program.	Borlaug BA, Kitzman DW, Patel S, Chinnakondepalli KM, Butler J, Davies MJ, Petrie MC, Shah SJ, Verma S, Núñez J, Einfeldt MN, Liisberg K, Salsali A, Kosiborod MN	Exercise function quantified by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) is       severely impaired in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction       (HFpEF). This prespecified secondary analysis of pooled data from the       STEP-HFpEF Program (Research Study to Investigate How Well Semaglutide Works in       People Living With Heart Failure and Obesity) examined factors associated with       impaired exercise function at baseline, detailed effects of semaglutide on 6MWD,       and on other key trial endpoints according to baseline 6MWD in patients with       HFpEF. Associates of 6MWD were assessed at baseline, and effects of       semaglutide on 6MWD were evaluated at early (20 weeks) and final (52 weeks) time       points, across subgroups, and according to the magnitude of weight loss achieved.       Effects of semaglutide on the dual primary (changes in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy       Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score [KCCQ-CSS] and body weight) and       secondary/exploratory endpoints were contrasted by tertiles of baseline 6MWD.       The authors randomized 1,145 patients to semaglutide or placebo.       Compared with patients who had obesity-related HFpEF and higher 6MWD, those with       lower 6MWD were older and had lower KCCQ-CSS, higher body mass index and waist       circumference, greater systemic inflammation (higher C-reactive protein), and       more severe congestion (higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, more       diuretic use). Treatment with semaglutide increased 6MWD compared with placebo,       an effect apparent at 20 weeks (treatment difference 14.6 m [95% 8.6-20.7 m;       P < 0.0001]) that was maintained at 52 weeks (treatment difference 17.1 m [95%       9.2-25.0 m; P < 0.0001]). Increases in 6MWD with semaglutide (vs placebo)       were similar across all relevant subgroups, with no significant interactions.       Treatment with semaglutide increased KCCQ-CSS and reduced body weight, reduced       C-reactive protein, improved the hierarchical composite (death, heart failure       events, change in KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD), and reduced N-terminal pro-B-type       natriuretic peptide across the spectrum of baseline 6MWD (all P(interaction) =       NS). Each 1-unit decrease in body mass index on treatment with semaglutide was       associated with a 4.1 m (95% 2.4-5.7 m) increase in 6MWD (P < 0.0001).       In patients with obesity-related HFpEF, impaired 6MWD is most       strongly associated with excess adiposity, congestion, and inflammation.       Semaglutide-mediated improvements in HF-related symptoms, physical limitations,       and exercise function were consistent across the spectrum of baseline 6MWD,       observed as early as 20 weeks after the initiation of treatment, preceding       maximal weight loss. The effects were consistent across subgroups. There was       strong correlation between greater magnitude of weight loss and greater       improvements in 6MWD.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.004	Functional RNA splitting drove the evolutionary emergence of type V CRISPR-Cas       systems from transposons.	Jin S, Zhu Z, Li Y, Zhang S, Liu Y, Li D, Li Y, Luo Y, Cheng Z, Zhao KT, Gao Q, Yang G, Li H, Liang R, Zhang R, Qiu JL, Zhang YE, Liu JG, Gao C	Transposon-encoded TnpB nucleases gave rise to type V CRISPR-Cas12 effectors       through multiple independent domestication events. These systems use different       RNA molecules as guides for DNA targeting: transposon-derived right-end RNAs       (reRNAs or omega RNAs) for TnpB and CRISPR RNAs for type V CRISPR-Cas systems.       However, the molecular mechanisms bridging transposon activity and CRISPR       immunity remain unclear. We identify TranCs (transposon-CRISPR intermediates)       derived from distinct IS605- or IS607-TnpB lineages. TranCs utilize both CRISPR       RNAs and reRNAs to direct DNA cleavage. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM)       structure of LaTranC from Lawsonibacter sp. closely resembles that of the ISDra2       TnpB complex; however, unlike a single-molecule reRNA, the LaTranC guide RNA is       functionally split into a tracrRNA and crRNA. An engineered RNA split of ISDra2       TnpB enabled activity with a CRISPR array. These findings indicate that       functional RNA splitting was the primary molecular event driving the emergence of       diverse type V CRISPR-Cas systems from transposons.	Cell	29/09/2025
10.11477/mf.1416202125	[A case of Coexistent Persistent Trigeminal and Hypoglossal Arteries Manifested       with Neurovascular Compression Syndrome by Hypertension].	Asayama K, Hayashi K, Kanai Y, Tahara N, Kato Y, Abe S, Mitaki S, Nagai A	A 70-year-old woman visited our hospital with hypertension, diplopia, and right       orbital pain. Neurological examination revealed right ophthalmoplegia. CT       angiography and MRI identified a right persistent trigeminal artery (PTA), right       persistent hypoglossal artery, and bovine aortic arch. The right internal carotid       artery (ICA) was displaced laterally in the cavernous sinus due to the       bifurcation of the PTA. Compression of the right oculomotor nerve, right       trochlear nerve, and first division of the right trigeminal nerve by the       elongated right ICA was noted and considered a potential cause of the       ophthalmoplegia and orbital pain. Symptoms improved with normalization of blood       pressure. During embryonic development, the right posterior communicating artery       and bilateral vertebral arteries were aplastic or hypoplastic, which suggests       that these carotid-basilar anastomoses may have remained as supply routes to       provide sufficient blood flow to the posterior cerebral circulation. This is an       extremely rare case of embryological implications manifested with neurovascular       compression syndrome.

10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100764	Aspirin and healthy lifespan in older people: main outcome of the ASPREE-XT       observational study.	Shah RC, Ryan J, Webb KL, Wolfe R, Chan A, Chong TT, Ernst ME, Espinoza SE, Flynn O, Lee SY, McNeil J, Nelson MR, Orchard SG, Reid CM, Sheets K, Stocks NP, Weerasinghe NS, Wilson ME, Woods RL, Murray AM	In the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical       trial, low-dose aspirin was not associated with survival free of dementia and       persistent physical disability (a measure of a healthy lifespan); however, there       was a small increased risk of death. Given the long pre-clinical phase of many       ageing conditions, we aimed to examine the legacy effect (post-trial) and the       longer-term effect of aspirin versus placebo through extended follow-up in the       ASPREE-XT observational study. Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014,       19 114 community-dwelling people in Australia and the USA, aged predominantly 70       years and older, were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin or placebo for a       median of 4·7 years as part of the ASPREE trial. Post-trial observational       follow-up continued for a median of 4·3 years (IQR 4·1-4·6). All components of       the primary endpoint (ie, incident dementia, persistent physical disability, and       death) were adjudicated by masked expert panels. Analyses used Cox proportional       hazards models with intention-to-treat. 15 633 participants (8836       [56·5%] were women, 6797 [43·5%] were men; 981 [6·3%] were not White) were       eligible for and agreed to observational follow-up. There was no effect of       randomisation to aspirin (34·37 events per 1000 person-years) versus placebo       (33·68 per 1000 person-years) on the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02;       95% CI 0·94-1·11; p=0·63) in the ASPREE-XT period. Similarly, over the period of       both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT, no long-term effect of aspirin versus placebo was       observed on the composite outcome of death, dementia, or persistent physical       disability over almost a decade of follow-up (HR 1·01; 95% CI 0·95-1·08; p=0·65),       including no long-term effect on deaths (1·06; 0·99-1·14; p=0·10). No effect of       aspirin on incident major haemorrhagic events as compared with placebo was found       in ASPREE-XT; however, aspirin was associated with an increased hazard for       incident major haemorrhagic events across both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT (1·24;       1·10-1·39). Low-dose aspirin does not appear to be effective in       promoting a healthy lifespan in initially healthy, community-dwelling older       people.

10.1038/s41586-025-09560-4	Efferocytic remodelling of pancreatic islet macrophages by limited β-cell death.	Zakharov PN, Chowdhury CS, Peterson OJ, Barron B, Vomund AN, Gorvel L, Unanue ER, Klechevsky E, Wan X, Ravichandran KS	The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy       insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas(1).       Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and       progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis       regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses(2), here we investigated how       efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of       pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional       approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic       macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell       apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD       mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase       in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis       and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes       in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by       co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the       e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4(+) T cells ex       vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4(+) T cells in vivo within       the islets. Analysing macrophage-T cell interactions within pancreatic islets       using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1-IGF1R       axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets.       Collectively, these data advance a concept that efferocytosis-associated       reprogramming of the islet macrophages and the subsequent influence on the       adaptive immune response could be beneficial in modulating diabetic autoimmunity.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01148-1	Oral iptacopan therapy in patients with C3 glomerulopathy: a randomised,       double-blind, parallel group, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.	Kavanagh D, Bomback AS, Vivarelli M, Nester CM, Remuzzi G, Zhao MH, Wong EKS, Wang Y, Krishnan I, Schuhmann I, Trapani AJ, Webb NJA, Meier M, Israni RK, Smith RJH	C3 glomerulopathy is an ultra-rare, severe form of glomerulonephritis       caused by overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. We aimed to       assess efficacy and safety of iptacopan (LNP023), an oral, proximal complement       inhibitor that targets factor B to selectively inhibit the alternative pathway of       the complement cascade. APPEAR-C3G was a multicentre, randomised,       double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of iptacopan versus placebo (both       in addition to supportive care [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)       inhibitors] and immunosuppression). Adult participants (aged 18-60 years) with       biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy were enrolled from 35 hospitals or medical       centres in 18 countries. Inclusion criteria included reduced serum C3       concentration (ie, <77 mg/dL [defined as <0·85 × lower limit of the central       laboratory normal range]) at screening, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of       1·0 g/g or higher at day -75 and day -15 before randomisation, estimated       glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) or higher at       screening and day -15, and vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis and       Streptococcus pneumoniae. All eligible participants were randomised 1:1 via       interactive response technology to either the iptacopan or the placebo group,       stratified by treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid, or both (yes or       no). During the 6-month double-blind period, participants orally received either       iptacopan 200 mg twice daily or placebo; this was followed by a 6-month       open-label period in which all participants received iptacopan 200 mg twice       daily. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria (measured by       log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR sampled from a 24-h urine collection)       at 6 months. The primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all       participants to whom study treatment was assigned by randomisation); all       participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in       the safety analysis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov       (NCT04817618) and the adult cohort has been completed. Between July 28,       2021, and Feb 15, 2023, 132 participants were screened, of whom 58 did not       complete the screening period and 74 (64% male; 69% White) were randomised 1:1 to       receive either iptacopan (n=38) or placebo (n=36). One participant in the placebo       group discontinued treatment during the open-label period. The 24-h UPCR       percentage change relative to baseline at 6 months was -30·2% (95% CI -42·8 to       -14·8) in the iptacopan group and 7·6% (-11·9 to 31·3) in the placebo group. In       the iptacopan group, the geometric mean of 24-h UPCR was 3·33 g/g (95% CI 2·79 to       3·97) at baseline and 2·17 g/g (1·62 to 2·91) at 6 months; in the placebo group,       this was 2·58 g/g (2·18 to 3·05) at baseline and 2·80 g/g (2·37 to 3·30) at 6       months. The primary endpoint was met with a relative reduction in 24-h UPCR at 6       months for iptacopan versus placebo of 35·1% (13·8 to 51·1; p=0·0014). 30 (79%)       of 38 participants in the iptacopan group had treatment-emergent adverse events,       compared with 24 (67%) of 36 participants in the placebo group; most of these       were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths, no treatment       discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events, and no meningococcal       infections. Serious adverse events were reported in three (8%) participants in       the iptacopan group and one (3%) participant in the placebo group.       Iptacopan showed a statistically significant, clinically       meaningful proteinuria reduction in addition to RAAS inhibitors and       immunosuppression at 6 months. Iptacopan was well tolerated with an acceptable       safety profile in patients with C3 glomerulopathy. Novartis Pharma.	Lancet (London, England)	25/09/2025
10.1038/s41392-025-02415-4	Multiple sclerosis: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention.	Boutitah-Benyaich I, Eixarch H, Villacieros-Álvarez J, Hervera A, Cobo-Calvo Á, Montalban X, Espejo C	Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous       system characterized by demyelination, axonal loss, and neuroinflammation,       culminating in progressive neurological disability. Despite significant advances       in understanding its immunopathogenesis, current immunotherapies remain limited       in their ability to halt disease progression, making multiple sclerosis incurable       and highlighting the critical need for novel therapeutic strategies.       Antigen-specific immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking approach that aims to       restore immune tolerance to myelin-derived antigens while preserving the       protective functions of the immune system. Unlike broad immunosuppressive       strategies, antigen-specific immunotherapy offers the potential for highly       targeted modulation of pathogenic immune responses, reducing off-target effects       and enhancing safety profiles. Over the last two decades, preclinical studies and       clinical trials have explored diverse antigen-specific immunotherapy modalities,       ranging from peptide-based vaccines to nanoparticle platforms, each aimed at       achieving durable tolerance in multiple sclerosis. This review provides a       comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis, covering its etiology, clinical       features, pathogenesis, pathology, and current therapeutic approaches. Thus, it       delves into the current state of antigen-specific immunotherapy research,       critically examining its successes and limitations while addressing the       translational challenges that must be overcome to realize its therapeutic       potential. By integrating insights from immunology, biotechnology, and       translational medicine, we propose directions for advancing antigen-specific       approaches in the quest for transformative multiple sclerosis therapies.

10.1002/advs.202503691	Single Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Define a Proinflammatory and Profibrotic       Niche After Kidney Injury.	Li L, Liao J, Zhang Y, Yao Z, Huang J, Wu K, Li L, Peng Y, Zhu H, Hong X, Liu X, Zhou L, Hou FF, Fu H, Liu Y	Kidney fibrosis is the common outcome of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It often       instigates in the focal sites by forming the fibrogenic niche after injury. In       this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and a spatial       transcriptomic (ST) approach, the cellular heterogeneity, spatial organization,       and molecular interactions are delineated in the fibrotic kidney. Through       analyses of the scRNA-seq and ST data from normal and fibrotic kidneys in mice       subjected to unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury, a tenascin C (TNC)-enriched,       proinflammatory, and profibrotic microenvironment is identified that facilitated       macrophage activation and promoted renal inflammation and fibrosis. Both       TNC-enriched decellularized kidney tissue scaffold and exogenous TNC protein       promoted bone marrow-derived macrophages activation though Toll-like receptor 4       (TLR4)/NF-κB signaling. Either pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 signaling or       genetic knockout of its gene alleviated renal inflammation and fibrosis by       inhibiting macrophage activation in vivo. Finally, chimeric mice that received       bone marrow transplantation from TLR4-deficient donors are protected against       kidney inflammation and fibrosis. These results suggest that TNC plays a crucial       role in orchestrating the formation of a proinflammatory and profibrotic niche       that promotes renal inflammation and fibrosis by activating macrophages via       TLR4/NF-κB signaling. The findings underscore the complex interplay among       fibroblasts, extracellular microenvironment, and macrophages that drive kidney       fibrosis.

10.1186/s13063-025-09038-8	Early implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in       patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites (eTIPS): a multicentre, randomised       controlled trial.	Bettinger D, Janoschke M, Jenkner C, Kaufmann M, van Gessel J, Otter HH, Schultheiss M, Thimme R	Portal hypertension is a major complication in patients with liver       cirrhosis, leading to severe outcomes such as variceal bleeding and ascites.       Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has emerged as an effective       interventional treatment of recurrent ascites and variceal bleeding. However, up       to 30% of patients with recurrent ascites show TIPS refractory ascites, and prior       data have shown that the frequency of paracenteses before TIPS implantation       predicts ascites clearance indicating that TIPS implantation may be too late in       some patients. Especially, patients with grade 2 ascites and a MELD score ≥ 15,       or grade 3 ascites irrespective of MELD score at first decompensation with       ascites face a high risk of further decompensation and mortality. Therefore,       these patients may benefit from early TIPS implantation in order to improve       post-TIPS mortality. We hypothesise that early TIPS implantation in these       selected patients at the time of the first decompensation may improve       transplantation-free survival compared to standard medical treatment (SMT).       The eTIPS study is a prospective, randomised, open, multicenter       interventional, superiority trial. Patients will be randomised 1:1 in the       intervention group with TIPS implantation and in the SMT group. The primary       endpoint is transplantation-free survival. Secondary endpoints include the time       to ascites with need for paracentesis and quality of life assessed six and       12 months after randomisation. Expanding the concept of early TIPS       implantation to ascites management may offer significant survival benefits and       may significantly change the treatment algorithm of patients with ascites.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.35200	Acute Surgery vs Conservative Treatment for Traumatic Acute Subdural Hematoma.	Van Essen TA, Yue JK, Barber J, Lingsma HF, Pisica D, den Boogert HF, van Dijck JT, Moojen WA, Hutchinson P, Markowitz AJ, Steyerberg EW, Okonkwo DO, Bodien YG, Valadka AB, Diaz-Arrastia R, Robertson CS, Foreman B, Wang VY, McCrea MA, Giacino JT, Yuh EL, de Ruiter GCW, Temkin NR, Maas AIR, Peul WC, Manley GT	It is unclear whether performing surgery for most patients with an       acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is superior to       conservative treatment. To compare the effectiveness of a strategy       preferring acute surgical ASDH evacuation with one preferring initial       conservative treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, This comparative       effectiveness study used data from February 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, from the       prospective observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in       Traumatic Brain Injury Study, conducted at 18 Level 1 trauma centers in the US.       The study included patients with nonpenetrating TBI presenting to the emergency       department and admitted within 24 hours after injury with ASDH detected on acute       head computed tomography scan. Statistical analysis was performed from December       1, 2022, to December 20, 2024. Acute surgical hematoma evacuation vs       initial conservative treatment, comparing outcomes between centers according to       treatment preferences, measured by the case mix-adjusted probability of       undergoing acute surgery (vs conservative treatment) per center. Functional disability at 6 months was assessed with the Glasgow       Outcome Scale-Extended at 6 months, analyzed with ordinal logistic regression       adjusted for prespecified confounders, quantified with a common odds ratio (OR).       Variation in center preference was quantified with a median OR (MOR). Of       2697 included patients, 711 (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [19.4] years; 539 men [76%]) had       an ASDH, of whom 148 (21%) underwent acute cranial surgery and 563 (79%)       underwent initial conservative treatment. The acute surgery cohort had lower mean       (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale scores (6.8 [4.4] vs 11.4 [4.6]), more pupil       abnormalities (both pupils unreacting: 43 of 133 [32%] vs 41 of 477 [9%]), and       fewer isolated ASDHs (eg, more with concurrent intracranial lesions; 92 of 133       [69%] vs 297 of 563 [53%%]) compared with the conservative treatment cohort. In       the surgical cohort, 129 of 148 patients (87%) underwent decompressive       craniectomy (DC), and 17 of 148 (11%) underwent craniotomy. In the conservative       treatment cohort, 67 of 563 patients (12%) underwent delayed cranial surgery (DC       or craniotomy). The proportion of patients undergoing acute surgery ranged from       0% to 86% (median, 17% [IQR, 5%-27%]) between centers, with up to a 3-fold higher       probability of prognostically similar patients receiving acute surgery in one       center compared with another random center (MOR, 2.95 [95% CI, 1.79-7.47];       P = .06). Center preference for acute surgery over initial conservative treatment       was not associated with a better outcome (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88-1.26] per 22%       [IQR, 5%-27%] increase in acute surgery at a given trauma center). In this comparative effectiveness study, similar patients with       traumatic ASDH were treated differently due to center-specific treatment       preferences. Outcomes were similar in centers preferring surgical evacuation and       those preferring initial conservative treatment. This study suggests that, for a       patient with ASDH for whom a neurosurgeon experiences clinical equipoise between       acute surgery vs (initial) conservative treatment, conservative treatment may be       considered.

10.2337/db25-0215	Regulatory Roles of IGF2R in Insulin Secretion and Adaptive β-Cell Proliferation.	Shirakawa J, De Jesus DF, Tsuno T, Basile G, Inoue R, Takatani T, Nishiyama A, Okawa ER, Tamura T, Terauchi Y, Kulkarni RN	Insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (IGF2R), also known as cation-independent       mannose-6-phosphate receptor, is localized in cytosolic vesicles and is unique in       its ability to transport enzymes to the lysosome and to clear IGF2 from the cell       surface by acting as a scavenger receptor. To evaluate the direct role of IGF2R       in β-cell biology, we undertook complementary in vitro knockdown and in vivo       knockout approaches. A β-cell line with a stable knockdown of IGF2R (IGF2RKD)       exhibited decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion and enhanced cell       proliferation. Tamoxifen-inducible β-cell-specific IGF2R knockout mice exhibited       impaired glucose tolerance and blunted insulin secretion after high-fat-diet       loading that was likely secondary to reduced β-cell mass due to attenuated       proliferation. β-cells with IGF2RKD had fewer autophagosomes after starvation and       reduced expression of p62, LC3B, and ULK1. Aged mice also had impaired autophagy       in βIGF2R-deficient β-cells. Reduced IGF2R function and N6-methyladenosine (m6A)       mRNA methylation were observed in islets from both mouse and human type 2       diabetes. Taken together, these data point to IGF2R as an important regulator of       insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and autophagy in mammalian β-cells.       The significance of insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor       (IGF2R) in β-cells remains unclear. To assess the physiological role of IGF2R in       β-cells, the effects of IGF2R deficiency in vivo and in vitro were investigated.       IGF2R modulates insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and autophagy in β-cells.       IGF2R plays a role in the regulation of β-cell biology.	Diabetes	03/10/2025
10.1186/s12943-025-02449-w	BRD9-p53-E2F1 circuit orchestrates cell growth and DNA damage repair in gastric       cancer.	Zhou Q, Wang Q, Duan Y, Zhang C, Liu T, Liu H, Zhao M, Hu Z	BRD9 is involved in multiple physiological and pathological pathways,       yet its functional role and molecular mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) remain       largely unexplored. Addressing this knowledge gap is critical given the       persistent global mortality burden of GC and the limited efficacy of current       therapeutic strategies. BRD9 expression in GC patients was       systematically analyzed using immunohistochemical (IHC) assays and transcriptomic       datasets. Comprehensive functional validation, employing cellular and murine       tumor models, elucidated BRD9's role in GC progression. Molecular pathways       underlying BRD9-mediated gastric carcinogenesis were delineated through       integrated approaches, including RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP),       subcellular fractionation, and luciferase reporter assays. BRD9 was       significantly overexpressed in GC and associated with poor patient prognosis.       Functionally, BRD9 promoted GC cell proliferation and enhanced DNA damage repair       capacity. Mechanistically, elevated BRD9 expression inhibited p53 nuclear       translocation via direct binding, subsequently activating the E2F transcription       factor family. Notably, we identified that E2F1 directly bound to and       transactivated the BRD9 promoter, establishing a positive feedback loop that       sustains BRD9 expression. Additionally, BRD9 knockdown sensitized GC cells to       cisplatin and oxaliplatin treatment. These findings highlight the       critical role of BRD9 in GC progression and its therapeutic potential. The       BRD9-p53-E2F1 axis acts as a crucial regulator of GC cell proliferation and DNA       damage response. Targeting BRD9 pharmacologically could be a novel therapeutic       approach to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and improve treatment outcomes in GC       patients.	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025
10.1038/s44161-025-00717-y	Spatial multiomics of acute myocardial infarction reveals immune cell       infiltration through the endocardium.	Wünnemann F, Sicklinger F, Bestak K, Nimo J, Thiemann T, Amrute JM, Nordbeck M, Hartmann N, Ibarra-Arellano MA, Tanevski J, Chazotte M, Heine C, Frey N, Lavine KJ, Coscia F, Saez-Rodriguez J, Leuschner F, Schapiro D	Myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide.       Even though it is well established that the complex interplay between different       cell types determines the overall healing response after MI, the precise changes       in the tissue architecture are still poorly understood. In this study, we       generated an integrative cellular map of the acute phase after murine MI using a       combination of imaging-based transcriptomics (Molecular Cartography) and       antibody-based highly multiplexed imaging (Sequential Immunofluorescence). This       enabled us to evaluate cell type compositions and changes at subcellular       resolution over time. We observed the recruitment of leukocytes to the infarcted       heart through the endocardium and performed unbiased spatial proteomic analysis       using Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) to investigate the underlying mechanisms. DVP       identified von Willebrand factor (vWF) as an upregulated mediator of inflammation       24 hours after MI, and functional blocking of vWF reduced the infiltration of C-C       chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2)-positive monocytes and worsened cardiac function       after MI.

10.1186/s12933-025-02920-4	Dual modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism by a nutraceutical combination in       patients at cardiometabolic risk: results from a multicenter randomized       controlled trial.	Pacella D, Lembo M, Trimarco V, Izzo A, Manzi MV, Jankauskas SS, Forzano I, Gallo P, Spinelli A, Morisco C, Cristiano S, Rozza PI, Esposito E, Rozza F, Esposito L, Bear SKB, Giugliano G, Santulli G	Recent evidence suggests that inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl       coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, has       beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and blood pressure (BP), but detrimental       consequences on glycemia. Nutraceuticals (NUTs) containing both Monacolin K (MK)       and Morus alba have been shown to be more effective in lowering lipids compared       to NUT formulations containing only MK. However, the effects of these NUTs on       glucose homeostasis have not been fully determined. To evaluate the       association between LDL-C-lowering therapy and glycemia in patients receiving NUT       combinations with or without Morus alba, we analyzed data from a prospective,       randomized, active-treatment controlled trial (NCT02898805), which enrolled 359       patients to compare the effects of a NUT combination containing MK alone       (Formulation 1, F1; n = 170) versus one containing MK and Morus alba (Formulation       1, F2; n = 189). Participants in the two treatment arms (F1 vs. F2) were       comparable in terms of sex, age, metabolic parameters, and BP. After 3 months,       both groups experienced significant reductions in LDL-C, fasting plasma glucose,       HbA1c, and HOMA index. F2 treatment led to a significantly greater reduction in       glycemic levels compared to F1 treatment (b = - 16, p < 0.001). Notably, a       divergent trend emerged over time: an inverse relationship between LDL-C and       glycemic levels was observed in the F1 group, while a significant direct       association between LDL-C and glycemic levels was detected in the F2 group       (b = 0.06, p = 0.002). Taken together, our findings indicate that       the treatment with a NUT combination containing Morus alba simultaneously reduces       plasma levels of LDL-C and glucose.

Through whole genome sequencing for 217       African ancestral cases (186 southern African, 31 Pan representative), we       identify 172 potentially pathogenic variants in 78 DNA damage repair or PCa       related genes. Prevalence for reported (13/217, 5.99%) and cumulative predicted       (24/217, 11.06%) variants of significance (11 genes) falls below that reported       for non-Africans. Conversely, BRCA1, HOXB13, CDK12, MLH1, MSH2, and BRIP1 remain       unimpacted. Through pathogenic ranking based on variant frequency and       functionality, clinical presentation and tumour-matched biallelic inactivation,       top-ranked candidates include PREX2, POLE, FAT1, BRCA2, POLQ, LRP1B and ATM.       Besides notable impact of DNA polymerases, including POLG, Fanconi anaemia genes       include FANCD2, FANCA, FANCG, ERCC4, FANCE and FANCI, while DNA mismatch repair       genes MSH3 and PMS1 outranked known namesakes MSH6 and PMS2. This study provides       insights into the spectrum of African-relevant potentially pathogenic PCa       variants, highlighting much-needed gene candidates for ancestry-inclusive       germline testing.

10.1371/journal.pone.0048639	The neural correlates of identity faking and concealment: an FMRI study.	Ding XP, Du X, Lei D, Hu CS, Fu G, Chen G	The neural basis of self and identity has received extensive research. However,       most of these existing studies have focused on situations where the internal       representation of the self is consistent with the external one. The present study       used fMRI methodology to examine the neural correlates of two different types of       identity conflict: identity faking and concealment. Participants were presented       with a sequence of names and asked to either conceal their own identity or fake       another one. The results revealed that the right insular cortex and bilaterally       inferior frontal gyrus were more active for identity concealment compared to the       control condition, whereas identity faking elicited a significantly larger       percentage signal increase than the control condition in the right superior       frontal gyrus, left calcarine, and right caudate. These results suggest that       different neural systems associated with both identity processing and deception       were involved in identity concealment and faking.	PloS one	01/01/2012
10.1038/s41598-025-17956-5	Development of cognitive, motor, metabolic, and mutant huntingtin aggregation in       the zQ175 mouse model of Huntington's disease.	McLean FH, Monteiro O, Lelos MJ, Ekkunagul T, Spicer RM, Rybnicek J, Lambert JJ, Langston RF	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease. In humans,       the clinical diagnosis is often dependent on the emergence of motor symptoms.       However, cognitive impairments and metabolic changes can be early indicators. HD       mouse models are a useful tool to understand disease progression, however,       relatively few studies have monitored the timeline for the emergence of cognitive       indices with motor and metabolic phenotypes in parallel. In this study,       cognitive, motor, and metabolic phenotypes were investigated at different ages in       the zQ175 knock-in mouse alongside immunohistochemical and long-term potentiation       (LTP) studies. We demonstrated that zQ175 mice developed impaired hippocampal LTP       at 3-months and cognitive deficits in visuospatial attention were evident by       4-months. Long-term and spatial memory impairments emerged by 12-months,       alongside motor impairments. Additionally, an anxiolytic-like phenotype emerged       at 6-months. Differences in body weight were also detected from 6-months onwards,       primarily driven by a reduction in fat mass. Additionally, reduced brain weight       and the presence of huntingtin aggregates in the hippocampus, striatum and       hypothalamus were observed at 12-months. These data support the zQ175 mouse as a       model of HD, which recapitulates many aspects of the disease progression in       humans and can be used to understand mechanisms underlying the disease.

10.1016/j.stemcr.2025.102649	Integrated profiling of iPSC-derived motor neurons carrying C9orf72, FUS, TARDBP,       or SOD1 mutations.	Ma GM, Xia CC, Lyu BY, Liu J, Luo F, Guan MF, Wang JY, Sun L, Zhang L, Chen Y, Mao YW, Yu GQ, Wang WY	Here, we conducted temporal RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling of human induced       pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived       motor neurons (iMNs) carrying C9orf72, FUS, TARDBP, or SOD1 mutations in both       patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy individuals. We       discovered dysregulated gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) throughout       iMN development and maturation, and iMNs with mutations in ALS-associated genes       displayed enrichment of cytoskeletal defects and synaptic alterations from the       premature stage to mature iMNs. Our findings indicate that synaptic gene       dysfunction is a common molecular hallmark of familial ALS, which may result in       neuronal susceptibility and progressive motor neuron degeneration. Analysis of       upstream splicing factors revealed that differentially expressed RNA-binding       proteins (RBPs) in iMNs from patients with ALS may cause abnormal AS events.       Overall, our research provides a comprehensive and valuable resource for gaining       insights into the shared mechanisms of familial ALS pathogenesis during motor       neuron development and maturation in iMN models.

10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00283-8	Assessment of the role of small airway dysfunction in relation to exacerbation       risk in patients with well controlled asthma (ATLANTIS): an observational study.	Galant SP, Kuks PJM, Kole TM, Kraft M, Siddiqui S, Fabbri LM, Beghé B, Rabe KF, Papi A, Brightling CE, Singh D, Kocks JWH, Franzini L, Vonk JM, Kerstjens HAM, Heijink IH, Pouwels SD, Slebos DJ, van den Berge M	Recent surveys suggest that asthma remains inadequately controlled in       more than 50% of adults with asthma despite guideline-based standard therapy.       Small airways are often under-recognised as major sites of airway obstruction and       inflammation. This might be related to lack of assessment with current tools such       as impulse oscillometry, and thus under-treatment might explain inadequate       control. Small airway dysfunction, which is common in adults with well controlled       asthma, might represent an important biomarker of future risk of exacerbations.       We aimed to investigate whether small airway dysfunction is present in patients       with well controlled asthma and, if so, whether it is a risk factor for future       exacerbations in this population. The observational Assessment of Small       Airways Involvement in Asthma (ATLANTIS) study included 773 extensively       characterised patients with asthma aged 18-65 years from 29 primary and specialty       clinics in nine countries from June 30, 2014, to March 3, 2017. Patients were       required to be diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months before inclusion based on       evidence of airway hyper-responsiveness, bronchodilator reversibility, or peak       expiratory flow variability. Patients were required to have stable asthma,       defined as no asthma exacerbations and regular asthma treatment at a consistent       dose for 8 weeks before baseline visits. The current analysis included patients       with well controlled asthma, defined as an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)       score of less than 0·75 at baseline. Small airway dysfunction was defined, based       on deviation from predicted values of impulse oscillometry parameters, as a Z       score of more than 1·645 for R5-R20 (resistance at 5 Hz minus resistance at 20       Hz) and AX (area of reactance) and a Z score of less than -1·645 for X5       (reactance at 5 Hz), with additional analyses exploring severe small airway       dysfunction (Z score of 3 or -3). ATLANTIS is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,       NCT02123667. Of 773 patients, ACQ-6 assessments were available for 772       patients. Among these patients, 384 (50%) were classified as having well       controlled asthma, and small airway dysfunction was present in 108 (36% [95% CI       30-41]) of 304 patients with impulse oscillometry data available for R5-R20, 89       (34% [28-42]) of 261 patients with data for AX, and 79 (26% [21-31]) of 303       patients with data for X5. In the multivariable analysis, we found that       R5-R20-defined small airway dysfunction was associated with increased risk of       future exacerbations, independent of age, sex, smoking status, Global Initiative       for Asthma steps 4-5, previous exacerbations, percentage of predicted FEV(1),       ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity, and peripheral blood eosinophil       count (hazard ratio [HR] 2·26 [95% CI 1·05-4·85]; p=0·038), whereas AX (2·07       [0·91-4·70]; p=0·082) and X5 (0·86 [0·33-2·21]; p=0·75) were not associated with       exacerbations. For severe small airway disease, both R5-R20 (HR 2·80 [95% CI       1·26-6·26]; p=0·012) and AX (2·51 [1·04-6·04]; p=0·041) became independent       predictors of future exacerbations, whereas X5 remained non-significant (0·99       [0·29-3·32]; p=0·98). We have addressed an undervalued trait by       showing that small airway dysfunction is a common, sensitive, early independent       risk biomarker for future exacerbations in adults with well controlled asthma.

10.1038/s41467-025-63718-2	Engineered exosomes with Kras(G12D) specific siRNA in pancreatic cancer: a phase       I study with immunological correlates.	Kalluri VS, Smaglo BG, Mahadevan KK, Kirtley ML, McAndrews KM, Mendt M, Yang S, Maldonado AS, Sugimoto H, Salvatierra ME, Solis Soto LM, Haymaker C, Finch R, Gagea M, Fluty AC, Ludtke SJ, Jack Lee J, Jain AK, Varadhachary G, Shroff RT, Maitra A, Shpall E, Pant S, Kalluri R	Oncogenic KRAS is amongst the key genetic drivers for initiation and maintenance       of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we show that engineered       exosomes with Kras(G12D) specific siRNA (iExoKras(G12D)) reveal a biodistribution       in pancreas with negligible toxicity in preclinical studies in mice and Rhesus       macaques. Clinical testing of iExoKras(G12D) in the iEXPLORE (iExoKras(G12D) in       Pancreatic Cancer) Phase I study employed a non-randomized single-arm classical       3 + 3 dose escalation design (Phase Ia), followed by an accelerated titration       design (Phase Ib) (NCT03608631). The primary outcomes included safety,       tolerability and target engagement, and the secondary outcomes aimed to assess       disease control. Patients with advanced metastatic disease were enrolled after       failure of multiple lines of therapy. iExoKras(G12D) therapy was well-tolerated:       the primary outcomes were met with iExoKras(G12D) showing no dose-limiting       toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached even at the highest dose. In       some cases, iExoKras(G12D) therapy was associated with stable disease response       (secondary outcome). Downregulation of KRAS(G12D) DNA and suppression of       phospho-Erk was documented together with an increase in intratumoral CD8(+) T       cells following treatment. The CD8(+) T cell recruitment priming by       iExoKras(G12D) informed on potential efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy and       lead to validation testing in preclinical PDAC models. Combination therapy of       iExoKras(G12D) and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, but not anti-PD1, revealed robust       pre-clinical anti-tumor efficacy via FAS mediated CD8(+) T cell anti-tumor       activity. This first-in-human, precision medicine clinical trial and supporting       preclinical functional studies offer new insights into priming of immunotherapy       by oncogenic Kras inhibitor for future opportunistic combination therapy for PDAC       patients.

10.1186/s12974-025-03552-x	Cytokine expression profile in the human brain of older adults.	Godoy JB, Vialle RA, Dos Santos L, Raittz RT, Wang Y, Menon V, De Jager PL, Schneider JA, Tasaki S, Bennett DA, Guizelini D, de Paiva Lopes K	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition linked to       chronic neuroinflammation. This study investigates the cytokine gene expression       profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD       to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease       pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of       cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the       AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β       deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus       transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such       as microglia and astrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory       response in AD. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the expression of       certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that       cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation may play an important role in       neurodegeneration and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising       strategy for developing new therapies.

10.2337/db25-0282	Trem2+ Macrophages Alleviate Renal Tubule Lipid Accumulation and Ferroptosis in       Diabetic Nephropathy by Repressing IL-1β-Mediated CD36 Expression.	Wang X, Wan J, Wang C, Tong Y, Chen Y, Wang X, Liu J, Li Q, Dong Z, Hong Q, Sun X, Cai G, Ouyang Q, Chen X	The presence of macrophages surrounding lipotoxic tubular epithelial cells (TECs)       is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Nevertheless, the mechanisms of       communication between these cell types are not well understood. Previous studies       have revealed a unique subset of macrophages that express triggering receptor       expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) in kidneys of human patients and mice with       DN. Here, we explored the characteristics and the function of Trem2+ macrophages       in the progress of DN. RNA-sequencing of macrophages in kidneys of Trem2 knockout       (KO) mice fed a high-fat diet plus streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) revealed functional       enrichment of metabolic processes, cytokine production, positive regulation of       extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades, and the regulation of       phagocytosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that Trem2+ macrophages reduced lipid       accumulation and mitigated ferroptosis of TECs in diabetic mice. Mechanistically,       Trem2-deficient macrophages amplified the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)       through activating the ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, IL-1β triggered CD36       expression via the transcription factor NF-κB. Bioinformatics and functional       assays showed NF-κB binds the CD36 promoter, which directly bound to the       promoters of CD36 to facilitate its transcription. Inhibition of NF-κB blocked       IL-1β-induced CD36 production. This mechanism is exacerbated in Trem2-deficient       macrophages, which release excess IL-1β to activate NF-κB in tubular cells,       promoting CD36-dependent lipid uptake and ferroptosis. Additionally, we found       Trem2 plays a role in enhancing the phagocytosis and clearance of ferroptotic       cells by bone marrow-derived macrophages. Altogether, our results suggest Trem2+       macrophages maintain homeostasis of the renal microenvironment and exert a       protective function in DN. Levels of triggering receptor       expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) in macrophages are increased in human       patients and in mice with diabetic nephropathy. Trem2 suppresses the       extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting       IL-1β production in macrophages. Macrophage Trem2 deficiency exacerbates tubular       cell lipid deposition and ferroptosis by increasing CD36 expression in an       IL-1β-dependent manner.	Diabetes	03/10/2025
10.1016/0888-7543(95)80042-k	A 1.8-Mb YAC contig spanning three members of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene       family (Pdgfra, Kit, and Flk1) on mouse chromosome 5.	Brunkow ME, Nagle DL, Bernstein A, Bucan M	"We constructed a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning the genes       encoding Kit (Kit), the platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor (Pdgfra),       and fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1), three members of a receptor tyrosine kinase gene       family located in the central portion of mouse chromosome 5. The orientation of       YAC clones and the extent of their overlap was determined by ""probe content       mapping,"" that is, hybridization analysis of YAC clones using the available gene       probes and YAC end sequences. For four YAC clones, which constitute a minimal set       spanning 1.8 Mb, a detailed restriction map was constructed. This map, in       conjunction with the previously published long-range restriction map, indicates       the order, the physical distances, and the relative transcriptional orientations       of the Pdgfra, Kit, and Flk1 genes. The YAC clones and corresponding YAC end       probes presented here provide an important resource for the molecular analysis of       a cluster of developmental mutations, namely dominant white spotting (W), patch       (Ph), recessive spotting (rs), and rump-white (Rw), associated with this       chromosomal region."

10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00476-1	Long COVID associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among children and adolescents       in the omicron era (RECOVER-EHR): a retrospective cohort study.	Zhang B, Wu Q, Jhaveri R, Zhou T, Becich MJ, Bisyuk Y, Blanceró F, Chrischilles EA, Chuang CH, Cowell LG, Fort D, Horowitz CR, Kim S, Ladino N, Liebovitz DM, Liu M, Mosa ASM, Schwenk HT, Suresh S, Taylor BW, Williams DA, Morris JS, Forrest CB, Chen Y	Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) remain a major       public health challenge. Although previous studies have focused on characterising       PASC in children and adolescents after an initial infection, the risks of PASC       after reinfection with the omicron variant remain unclear. We aimed to assess the       risk of PASC diagnosis (U09.9) and symptoms and conditions potentially related to       PASC in children and adolescents after a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the       omicron period. This retrospective cohort study used data from 40       children's hospitals and health institutions in the USA participating in the       Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative. We included patients       younger than 21 years at the time of cohort entry; with documented SARS-CoV-2       infection after Jan 1, 2022; and who had at least one health-care visit within 24       months to 7 days before the first infection. The second SARS-CoV-2 infection was       confirmed by positive PCR, antigen tests, or a diagnosis of COVID-19 that       occurred at least 60 days after the first infection. The primary endpoint was a       clinician-documented diagnosis of PASC (U09.9). Secondary endpoints were 24       symptoms and conditions previously identified as being potentially related to       PASC. We used the modified Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risk       (RR) between the second and first infection episodes, adjusted for demographic,       clinical, and health-care utilisation factors using exact and propensity-score       matching. We identified 407 300 (87·5%) of 465 717 eligible children       and adolescents with a first infection episode and 58 417 (12·5%) with a second       infection episode from Jan 1, 2022, to Oct 13, 2023, in the RECOVER database.       233 842 (50·2%) patients were male and 231 875 (49·8%) were female. The mean age       was 8·17 years (SD 6·58). The incident rate of PASC diagnosis (U09.9) per million       people per 6 months was 903·7 (95% CI 780·9-1026·5) in the first infection group       and 1883·7 (1565·1-2202·3) in the second infection group. Reinfection was       associated with a significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis       (U09.9) (RR 2·08 [1·68-2·59]) and a range of symptoms and conditions potentially       related to PASC (RR range 1·15-3·60), including myocarditis, changes in taste and       smell, thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism, heart disease, acute kidney injury,       fluid and electrolyte disturbance, generalised pain, arrhythmias, abnormal liver       enzymes, chest pain, fatigue and malaise, headache, musculoskeletal pain,       abdominal pain, mental ill health, POTS or dysautonomia, cognitive impairment,       skin conditions, fever and chills, respiratory signs and symptoms, and       cardiovascular signs and symptoms. Children and adolescents face       a significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with       SARS-CoV-2. These findings add to previous evidence linking paediatric long COVID       to multisystem effects and highlight the need to promote vaccination in younger       populations and support ongoing research to better understand PASC, identify       high-risk subgroups, and improve prevention and care strategies.

10.1126/sciimmunol.adu6730	Vaccination-induced T cell responses maintain polyclonality with high antigen       receptor avidity.	Kocher K, Drost F, Tesfaye AM, Moosmann C, Schülein C, Grotz M, D'Ippolito E, Graw F, Spriewald B, Busch DH, Bogdan C, Tenbusch M, Schubert B, Schober K	Clonal expansion is a hallmark of adaptive immunity and has been challenging to       investigate in humans in a standardized manner compared with animal models. We       studied a cohort of 29 healthy individuals who received three mRNA vaccinations       against SARS-CoV-2 before a breakthrough infection. We characterized the       magnitude, phenotype, and clonal composition of CD8 T cell responses against 16       epitope specificities by ELISpot; flow cytometry; and single-cell RNA, protein,       and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. One hundred six TCRs from five       epitope-specific repertoires were reexpressed and tested for peptide sensitivity.       Whereas vaccination-recruited T cell repertoires were enriched for high-avidity       TCRs, differential clonal expansion was not linked to fine avidity differences.       Instead, maintenance of polyclonality ensured robustness in counteracting viral       mutational escape through altered epitopes. Deciphering the functionality of       human antigen-specific T cell repertoires instructs our understanding of human T       cell biology and may guide the development of vaccines and other immunotherapies.

10.1080/15502783.2025.2568048	A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial to evaluate the effect       of a turmeric formulation on muscle soreness and function recovery in moderately       active adults.	Schönenberger KA, Laval J, Woods T, Truillet R, Naranjo-Modad S, Mettler S, Fança-Berthon P	Turmeric may alleviate exercise-induced muscle soreness (delayed       onset muscle soreness) and muscular function loss due to the strong       anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of its active compounds, the       curcuminoids. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a       highly bioavailable turmeric formulation on delayed onset muscle soreness in male       adults. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover       trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04946981), 44 moderately active adults (34 males, 10       females, mean [SD] age = 33.7 [6.4] years) ingested a turmeric formulation       (300 mg/day, thereof 90 mg of active curcuminoids) or placebo for five days. On       the second day, muscle damage was induced with exercise (30 min downhill run at       70% VO₂ max). Immediately before and 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise,       muscle soreness during squat on quadriceps (visual analog scale), muscular       function (knee extension dynamometer), muscle power (vertical jump test), muscle       damage (serum creatine kinase), range of motion (knee flexion), and perceived       wellness and wellbeing (questionnaire) were assessed. During exercise, exhaustion       was assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion. The primary trial       population consisted of the male participants, outcomes in females were       considered exploratory. Adjusted least squares means with standard errors (SE)       were obtained from mixed models for repeated measures. There were no       significant differences between the turmeric formulation and placebo in muscle       soreness area under the curve from pre-exercise to 72 hours post-exercise and at       all timepoints, except for a trend observed in males 72 hours after exercise       (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = -4.8 [2.7] mm, p = 0.0776).       Muscle soreness recovery (difference between soreness at 72 hours and maximal       post-exercise soreness) was significantly greater with the turmeric formulation       compared to placebo (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = -10.7%       [4.3%], p = 0.0184 for the male participants, and -7.9% [3.6%], p = 0.0346 for       the total sample). Furthermore, in males, the decrease from pre-exercise to       24 hours after exercise in isokinetic peak torque was significantly lower with       the turmeric formulation (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = 11.0       [4.9] Nm, p = 0.0275), as was the decrease in isokinetic max rep work (adjusted       mean [SE] for difference from placebo = 11.6 [4.9] J, p = 0.0195), while vertical       jump peak power at 24 hours after exercise was higher (median [interquartile       range] with the turmeric formulation vs. placebo = 931.1 [825.9; 1001.1] W vs.       916.5 [824.8; 989.5] W, p = 0.0445). Supplementation with the       turmeric formulation can accelerate exercise-induced muscle soreness recovery and       could attenuate muscular function loss and improve performance after unaccustomed       exercise in young, moderately active, male adults.

10.1002/advs.202509695	DCAF12 Ubiquitin Ligase Promotes Lung Cancer Metastasis by Modulating the       TRiC/CCT Chaperonin Complex.	Wang Z, Huang H, Huang K, Cui X, Wu L, Lin R, Zhao Z, Chen H, Zheng C, Jin W, Chen S, Chen J, Xu Y, Wei D	Metastasis is the primary challenge in lung cancer treatment. Although       proteostasis supports tumor growth, the mechanism by which ubiquitin ligases       reprogram chaperone networks to drive metastasis is poorly understood. In this       study, it is revealed that DDB1-CUL4-associated factor (DCAF12), a substrate       receptor for CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligases, regulates metastatic progression       through ubiquitin-mediated proteostatic reprogramming. DCAF12 depletion       suppresses tumor cell migration and stemness in vitro and reduces       pulmonary/hepatic metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, DCAF12 catalyzes the       non-degradative ubiquitination of TRiC/CCT subunits, enhancing chaperonin       assembly and folding of cytoskeletal effectors (β-actin/tubulin) and oncogenic       clients (STAT3/Raptor/mLST8), thereby activating the YAP, STAT3, and mTOR       pathways. Both genetic knockdown and pharmacological blockade (via HSF1A) of this       axis potently inhibit metastasis. Clinically, DCAF12 overexpression is correlated       with YAP/STAT3 activation, advanced metastasis, and poor survival. Three key       insights are revealed: 1) ubiquitination-mediated TRiC/CCT regulation as a       metastatic switch, 2) DCAF12 as an oncogenic proteostasis hub, and 3) therapeutic       potential validated through multimodal targeting. These findings establish the       DCAF12-TRiC/CCT axis as a mechanistically novel target that simultaneously       disrupts cytoskeletal dynamics and oncogenic signaling, making it a promising       therapeutic strategy for metastatic lung cancer.

Its comparative efficacy in children has not been       established. CARE was a 52-week, open-label, parallel-group,       multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial in children aged 5-15 years       with asthma using SABA reliever monotherapy at 15 clinical trials sites in New       Zealand. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either budesonide 50       μg-formoterol 3 μg, two actuations as needed, or salbutamol 100 μg, two       actuations as needed. The primary outcome was asthma attacks as rate per       participant per year. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand       Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12620001091998. From Jan 28, 2021, to       June 23, 2023, we assessed 382 participants for eligibility. We randomly assigned       360 (94%) participants to treatment (179 [50%] to the budesonide-formoterol group       and 181 [50%] to the salbutamol group). The annualised rate of asthma attacks was       lower in the budesonide-formoterol group than in the salbutamol       group-cluster-adjusted rates 0·23 versus 0·41 per participant per year (relative       rate 0·55 [95% CI 0·35-0·86]; p=0·012). The number of participants with at least       one adverse event was 162 (91%) in the budesonide-formoterol group and 167 (92%)       in the salbutamol group (odds ratio 0·79 [95% CI 0·35-1·79]). In       children aged 5-15 years with mild asthma, budesonide-formoterol reliever       monotherapy is superior to salbutamol for preventing asthma attacks, with a       similar safety profile.

Although circulating miRNAs       have been linked to carcinogenesis, they have not yet been systematically       investigated in relation to risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We used       Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses to investigate the       association of genetically predicted plasma miRNA concentrations (2083 miRNAs in       710 individuals) with risk of CRC (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls). For miRNAs       associated with CRC risk, we also investigated their association with circulating       plasma proteins (4907 proteins in 35,559 participants), bidirectionally, using       MR. We performed pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) to explore downstream       molecular pathways. Associations of five miRNAs with CRC were found in       MR and supported in colocalization analyses. Specifically, miR-146a-5p,       miR-21-5p, and miR-4707-3p were positively, and miR-1908-5p and miR-6810-3p were       inversely associated with CRC risk. Several protein associations were found for       these miRNAs (range of proteins with P < 0.05: 78-796; 211 with FDR < 5%), and 11       pathways were identified in PEA, including regulation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine       kinase 4 (miR-6810-3p) and insulin-like growth factor pathways (miR-1908-5p).       Our results support a potential implication of miR-146a-5p,       miR-21-5p, miR-4707-3p, miR-1908-5p, and miR-6810-3p to CRC risk. However, their       downstream effects should be elucidated before they can be utilized as preventive       targets.	BMC medicine	02/10/2025

Here, in two chronic pain models, we       show that a single dose of psilocybin induces a rapid and sustained reversal of       both mechanical allodynia and anxiodepression-like states in adult male and       female mice. Using local psilocin injections, the key active metabolite of       psilocybin, we show that the engagement of prefrontal cortical circuits is       critical for the concurrent alleviation of both conditions. Two-photon calcium       imaging reveals that psilocin rapidly normalizes chronic pain-associated       hyperactivity in anterior cingulate cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.       Pharmacologic manipulations with full agonists of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors       replicated some, but not all, of psilocin's cellular and behavioral effects,       suggesting that psilocin's actions arise from partial agonism at these receptors       within shared circuits governing pain and mood processing.

10.1038/s43018-025-01054-6	Aberrant expression of SLAMF6 constitutes a targetable immune escape mechanism in       acute myeloid leukemia.	Sandén C, Landberg N, Peña-Martínez P, Thorsson H, Daga S, Puente-Moncada N, Rodriguez-Zabala M, von Palffy S, Rissler M, Lazarevic V, Juliusson G, Ohlin M, Hyrenius-Wittsten A, Orsmark-Pietras C, Lilljebjörn H, Ågerstam H, Fioretos T	Immunotherapy has shown limited success in acute myeloid leukemia (AML),       indicating an incomplete understanding of the underlying immunoregulatory       mechanisms. Here we identify an immune evasion mechanism present in 60% of AML       cases, wherein primitive AML cells aberrantly express the lymphoid surface       protein SLAMF6 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 6).       Knockout of SLAMF6 in AML cells enables T cell activation and highly efficient       killing of leukemia cells in coculture systems, demonstrating that SLAMF6       protects AML cells from recognition and elimination by the immune system in a       mode analogous to the programmed cell death protein-ligand (PDL1/PD1) axis.       Targeting SLAMF6 with an antibody against the SLAMF6 dimerization site inhibits       the SLAMF6-SLAMF6 interaction and induces T cell activation and killing of AML       cells both in vitro and in humanized in vivo models. In conclusion, we show that       aberrant expression of SLAMF6 is a common and targetable immune escape mechanism       that could pave the way for immunotherapy in AML.	Nature cancer	03/10/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-63885-2	SFPQ-TFE3 reciprocally regulates mTORC1 and induces lineage plasticity in a mouse       model of renal tumorigenesis.

However, no mouse models for SFPQ-TFE3-related       tumors exist and the underlying mechanisms of lineage plasticity remain unclear.       Here, we demonstrate that constitutive murine renal expression of SFPQ-TFE3       disrupts kidney development with early neonatal renal failure and death, while       post-natal induction induces infiltrative epithelioid tumors, that       morphologically and transcriptionally resemble human PEComas, with strong       activation of mTORC1 signaling via increased V-ATPase expression. Remarkably,       SFPQ-TFE3 expression is sufficient to induce lineage plasticity, with       down-regulation of the PAX2/PAX8 nephric lineage factors and tubular epithelial       markers, and up-regulation of PEComa differentiation markers in transgenic mice,       cell lines and human tRCC. mTOR inhibition downregulates SFPQ-TFE3 expression and       rescues PAX8 expression and transcriptional activity in vitro. These data provide       evidence of an epithelial cell-of-origin for TFE3-driven PEComas, highlighting a       reciprocal role for SFPQ-TFE3 and mTOR in driving lineage plasticity in the       kidney.

10.7150/thno.117582	GPX1-driven selenium nanoplatform reprograms MAMs-mediated organelle crosstalk to       reverse inflammatory adipose expansion in thyroid eye disease.	Tan Y, Zhang F, Cao J, Feng L, Xie B, Gao L, Chen X, Yan Z, Xiong W	Background: Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder       with limited therapeutic options due to the complexity of its oxidative,       metabolic, and inflammatory networks. This study aims to develop a selenium-based       nanoplatform that targets mitochondria-ER interactions to reverse inflammatory       adipose expansion in TED. Methods: We designed a dual-responsive selenium       nanoparticle (Se@LNT) modified with lentinan, capable of ROS/pH-triggered       release. Human primary orbital fibroblasts, bioinformatic analysis of public       datasets, and TED mouse models were used to investigate the therapeutic       mechanism. Results: Se@LNT undergoes intracellular metabolic conversion into       selenocysteine, which enhances GPX1 activity and promotes redox balance. It       exerts triple regulatory effects by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes to reduce       mtDNA leakage, downregulating GRP75 to normalize MAMs contact and calcium flux,       and suppressing PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling to relieve ER stress. Transcriptomic       profiling reveals multi-target modulation of immune-stromal interactions. In       vivo, Se@LNT achieves orbital targeting, rapid hepatic-renal clearance, and       significant reduction of adipose expansion with immune remodeling. Conclusions:       Se@LNT offers the first MAMs-targeted nanotherapy for TED by reprogramming       organelle crosstalk, restoring metabolic-immune homeostasis, and modifying       disease progression at the subcellular level.

10.1186/s12967-025-06818-3	VISTA expressed on tumor cells is regulated by m6A and influences immune       microenvironment through STAT3/CCL22 in NSCLC.	Xu H, Shen K, Jiang B, Xu Q, Li B, Ke Z, Cheng Q, Zhu S, Wang D, Song Y, Lv T	Immunotherapy is playing an increasingly vital role in the treatment       of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the challenge of immune evasion       remains prevalent. Therefore, investigating the regulatory mechanisms of the       tumor immune microenvironment could yield significant benefits. This       study utilized differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and Lasso-Cox to analyze       the GSE126044 dataset, identifying N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related molecules       that play significant roles in immunotherapy. The m6A modification of the       molecule were validated through m6A dot blot, MeRIP, RNA pull-down and RNA       stability assays. Their impact on the biological behavior of tumor cells (TCs)       was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, wound healing assays, transwell assays, co-culture       experiments and flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was conducted to       uncover downstream pathways and cytokines, followed by subsequent validation.       Lastly, validation was carried out in vivo. Through bioinformatics       analysis, we identified that V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell       Activation (VISTA) serves a crucial role in immunotherapy and that its expression       is regulated by m6A. It was subsequently confirmed that METTL3 enhances the m6A       modification levels of VISTA mRNA, which is recognized by YTHDF1. This       interaction improved the stability of VISTA mRNA, leading to increased expression       of VISTA proteins on the surface of TCs. The elevated expression of VISTA boosted       the cytotoxic response of CD8 + T cells toward TCs. RNA sequencing analysis       indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway significantly contributes to this process.       Overexpression of VISTA on TCs decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3, which in       turn reduced the expression and release of CCL22. This reduction alleviated       immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment, resulting in increased       enrichment and activity of CD8 + T cells and decreased enrichment of regulatory T       cells (Tregs), ultimately enhancing their cytotoxic effects against TCs.       We conduct a pioneering systematic study on the expression, function,       and molecular mechanisms of the VISTA molecule on NSCLC TCs. We propose that in       the tumor immune microenvironment, VISTA functions as both an immune checkpoint       and a regulator of CD8 + T cell activation/recruitment and Treg recruitment via       its expression on TCs.

10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3746	Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET-Guided Intensification of Salvage       Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.	Belliveau C, Saad F, Duplan D, Petit C, Delouya G, Taussky D, Barkati M, Lambert C, Beauchemin MC, Clavel S, Mok G, Igidbashian L, Gauthier-Paré AS, Nguyen TV, McLaughlin PY, Keu KV, DaSilva JN, Juneau D, Ménard C	Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography       (PSMA-PET) offers superior accuracy in detecting prostate cancer lesions leading       to intensified radiotherapy (RT), but its impact on patient outcomes is still       undefined. To evaluate whether intensification of salvage RT (SRT)       after radical prostatectomy (RP) guided by PSMA-PET (PSMAiSRT) is associated with       improved failure-free survival (FFS). DESIGN, SETTING, PSMAiSRT       was a stratified cohort within a larger PSMA-guided intensification of       radiotherapy (PSMAgRT) trial, a phase 2, two-center, registry-based randomized       clinical trial. Patients with biochemical recurrence following RP who were       eligible for standard-of-care (SOC) SRT from May 2018 to February 2021, were       eligible for randomization in the PSMAiSRT stratum. A total of 130 patients were       randomized, with 2 who did not proceed to radiotherapy (RT). The cutoff date for       the primary analysis was October 26, 2023. Patients were randomized       in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SOC SRT to the prostate bed, with or without       elective pelvic RT, with or without adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT), or       PSMA-PET/CT-guided SRT, intensified to detected sites of disease. The primary end point was FFS, defined as PSA progression (PSA       nadir >0.2 ng/mL), radiological progression, next-line therapy initiation, or       death. Among 128 patients (median [IQR] age, 71 [64-74] years), median       (range) PSA at enrollment was 0.3 (0.1-3.0) ng/mL. In the PSMAiSRT group, 33 of       64 patients (52%) received intensified SRT; with addition of pelvic RT (n = 16       [25%]), metastasis-directed RT (n = 2 [3%]), lymph node boost (n = 19 [30%]), or       prostate bed boost (n = 15). Adjuvant hormone therapy was equally prevalent in       both arms (55 [86%] control vs 54 [84%] PSMAiSRT). At a median (range) follow-up       of 37 (7-60) months, PSMAiSRT improved FFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI,       0.27-0.94; P = .04) and eugonadal FFS (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21-0.96; P = .03),       with its greatest benefit in the subgroup with PSA of 0.3 ng/mL or more (HR,       0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.79; P = .01). Fewer next-line treatment events occurred in       the PSMAiSRT arm (4 vs 12; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-1.02; P = .04). There were no       significant differences in toxic effects or quality of life between arms.       This phase 2 trial demonstrated an isotoxic improvement       in cancer control with PSMA-PET-guided intensification of SRT after RP.       Confirmatory evidence is awaited from a subsequently accrued phase 3 trial. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03525288.	JAMA oncology	02/10/2025
10.1186/1471-2407-8-221	Esophageal cancer risk by type of alcohol drinking and smoking: a case-control       study in Spain.	Vioque J, Barber X, Bolumar F, Porta M, Santibáñez M, de la Hera MG, Moreno-Osset E	The effect of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on esophageal       cancer (EC) has never been explored in Spain where black tobacco and wine       consumptions are quite prevalent. We estimated the independent effect of       different alcoholic beverages and type of tobacco smoking on the risk of EC and       its main histological cell type (squamous cell carcinoma) in a hospital-based       case-control study in a Mediterranean area of Spain. We only included       incident cases with histologically confirmed EC (n = 202). Controls were       frequency-matched to cases by age, sex and province (n = 455). Information on       risk factors was elicited by trained interviewers using structured       questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds       ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Alcohol drinking and tobacco       smoking were strong and independent risk factors for esophageal cancer. Alcohol       was a potent risk factor with a clear dose-response relationship, particularly       for esophageal squamous-cell cancer. Compared to never-drinkers, the risk for       heaviest drinkers (> or = 75 g/day of pure ethanol) was 7.65 (95%CI, 3.16-18.49);       and compared with never-smokers, the risk for heaviest smokers (> or = 30       cigarettes/day) was 5.07 (95%CI, 2.06-12.47). A low consumption of only wine       and/or beer (1-24 g/d) did not increase the risk whereas a strong positive trend       was observed for all types of alcoholic beverages that included any combination       of hard liquors with beer and/or wine (p-trend<0.00001). A significant increase       in EC risk was only observed for black-tobacco smoking (2.5-fold increase), not       for blond tobacco. The effects for alcohol drinking were much stronger when the       analysis was limited to the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 160), whereas       a lack of effect for adenocarcinoma was evidenced. Smoking cessation showed a       beneficial effect within ten years whereas drinking cessation did not.       Our study shows that the risk of EC, and particularly the squamous       cell type, is strongly associated with alcohol drinking. The consumption of any       combination of hard liquors seems to be harmful whereas a low consumption of only       wine may not. This may relates to the presence of certain antioxidant compounds       found in wine but practically lacking in liquors. Tobacco smoking is also a clear       risk factor, black more than blond.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1614702	Integrating bioinformatics and experimental validation to reveal a novel VRK       score as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Fu Z, Liu D, Chen M, Zhong G, Zhao Z, Gong J, Dai X, Hu J, Jia D, Cheng L, Cai D, Gong J	Vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family genes play a multifunctional       role in tumor development. However, the role of VRK family genes in       hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires further research. Moreover, the clinical       potential of the VRK-related model remains unclear. The aim of this study is to       construct a VRK-related model to predict HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy.       The data of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas       (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Gene Expression       Omnibus (GEO) databases. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)       algorithm was used to calculate the VRK score of each sample. Tumor IMmune       Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion       (TIDE) were used to evaluate immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint       response. pRRophetic was used for predicting drug sensitivity. CCK-8, colony       formation, wound healing, transwell and xenograft assays were used to       experimentally validate the biofunction of VRK2 in HCC. We found that       all VRK family genes were highly expressed in HCC. Compared with patients with       low VRK scores, patients with high VRK1 or VRK2 expression in the TCGA, ICGC, and       GSE14520 cohorts had poorer outcomes. Moreover, patients with a high VRK score in       the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 cohorts also had poorer outcomes. Importantly, Cox       analysis revealed that the VRK score was a potential independent risk factor for       HCC. Notably, TIMER2.0 and TIDE suggested that patients with high VRK scores had       higher immune checkpoint response rates. Similarly, drug sensitivity analyses       suggested that patients with high VRK scores were more resistant to sorafenib,       paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. Finally, experimental validation revealed       that VRK2 knockdown inhibited HCC development in vitro and in vivo. The VRK score was found to be a reliable indicator for predicting HCC prognosis       and therapeutic efficacy. VRK2 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.	Frontiers in immunology	01/01/2025

The circuit-level mechanisms underlying these       distinct symptom domains remain poorly understood, and treatments that address       both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of AD are limited. Here, we identify       anatomically, molecularly, and functionally distinct subpopulations of       supramammillary (SuM) neurons that project to either the dorsal or ventral       dentate gyrus (dDG or vDG). These distinct SuM neurons and their SuM-DG       subcircuits selectively regulate memory and emotion, respectively. In AD model       mice, SuM neurons targeting dDG or vDG display aberrant activity during memory or       emotional processing, and importantly, targeted optogenetic activation of SuM-dDG       or SuM-vDG pathways selectively restores cognitive or affective function. These       findings reveal SuM-DG subcircuits as parallel modulators of cognitive and       emotional states and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets for       addressing the multifaceted symptomatology of AD.

10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.01.007	Identification of Lacrimal Gland Postganglionic Innervation and Its Regulation of       Tear Secretion.	Jin K, Imada T, Hisamura R, Ito M, Toriumi H, Tanaka KF, Nakamura S, Tsubota K	Tear fluid secreted from the exocrine lacrimal gland (LG) has an essential role       in maintaining a homeostatic environment for a healthy ocular surface. Tear       secretion is regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the       autonomic nervous system, although the contribution of each component is not       fully understood. To investigate LG innervation, we identified sympathetic and       parasympathetic postganglionic nerves, specifically innervating the mouse LG, by       injecting a retrograde neuronal tracer into the LG. Interruption of neural       stimuli to the LG by the denervation of these postganglionic nerves immediately       and chronically decreased tear secretion, leading to LG atrophy along with       destruction of the lobular structure. This investigation also found that       parasympathetic, but not sympathetic, innervation was involved in these       alterations.	The American journal of pathology	01/01/2020
10.1038/s41590-025-02289-2	Chemotherapy-induced CA-repeat DNA fragments in breast cancer trigger antitumor       immune responses.	Zhang X, Huang P, Chen H, Yang C, Yang X, Liu Y, Wu B, Zeng W, Saw PE, Ye S, Li J, Wang J, Wu Z, Wang J, Li H, Huang JD, Zeng M, Li M, Liu Q, Su S, Song E, Chen J	Damage-associated molecular patterns generated by cancer treatment can modulate       antitumor immunity, but the underlying mechanisms of this effect are unclear.       Here we show that CA-enriched DNA fragments resulting from DNA-damaging       chemotherapy in MSH2-low tumors preferentially bind cGAS with strong affinity and       form biomolecular condensates by phase separation in the cytoplasm, resulting in       antitumor immunity. However, classical CA-poor DNAs released from MSH2-high tumor       cells engage AIM2, resulting in immunosuppression by upregulating PD-L1 and IDO.       Intratumoral administration of CA-rich DNA fragments enhanced antitumor immunity       in syngrafted PyMT tumors. Clinically, CA-rich DNA abundance in breast cancer       following chemotherapy was associated with increased tumor-antigen-reactive T       cells and better chemotherapeutic responses. Therefore, different tumor DNA       fragments can trigger opposing immune responses depending on their preference for       differential sensors. This study highlights another mechanistic link between       genome instability and immune modulation and the therapeutic potential of CA-rich       DNAs to enhance antitumor immunity.

10.1016/j.ccell.2025.09.002	Ketogenic diet inhibits glioma progression by promoting gut microbiota-derived       butyrate production.	Chen ML, He Y, Dong XH, Liu HF, Yan ZX, Lu XL, Miao QQ, Zhao QN, Zhang H, Luo L, Wang S, Li JY, Xiang DF, Lin Y, Li TR, Zhou XY, Zhou YY, Mao M, Zhang X, Wei H, Shi Y, Liu XD, Ping YF, Bian XW	The ketogenic diet (KD) is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma; however,       the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we first identify that glioma       patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced       butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with       decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially       enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate       production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an       anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in       mice. Crucially, KD's anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics       treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or       microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A.       muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation       and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free       mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or       supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025
10.1148/radiol.233057	Amplifying Research: The Potential for Podcasts to Boost Radiology Journal       Article Exposure.	Wang M, Le T, Leswick DA	Background Podcasts have become an increasingly popular method of communicating       information in medicine, including in radiology. However, the effect of podcasts       on the reach of journal articles remains unclear. Purpose To evaluate the       influence of Radiology podcasts on the performance metrics, including downloads,       citations, and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), of Radiology articles. Materials       and Methods This was a retrospective study. All articles published in the print       version of Radiology from January 2021 to December 2022 were reviewed; editorials       and case reports were excluded. Articles featured on Radiology podcasts were       included in the podcast group. Articles published within the same journal issue       and category were the nonpodcast group. Downloads, Google Scholar citations,       Dimensions citations, and AAS metrics were recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was       used to compare medians and evaluate differences between older and more recently       published articles. Results The podcast group, composed of 88 articles, exhibited       significantly higher median values for downloads (PG, 4521.0; nonpodcast group,       2123.0; P < .001), Google Scholar citations (podcast group, 14.5; nonpodcast       group, 10.0; P = .01), Dimensions citations (podcast group, 12.0; nonpodcast       group, 9.0; P = .01), and AAS (podcast group, 43.0; nonpodcast group, 10.0; P <       .001) compared with the nonpodcast group of 378 articles. Within both groups,       articles published in the earlier nonpodcast group (January to June 2021) had       higher downloads (podcast group, P = .08; nonpodcast group, P < .001), Google       Scholar citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001), and Dimension       citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001) than articles from the       later period (July to December 2022). AAS markedly increased in recent podcast       articles (P = .03), but AAS for nonpodcast articles significantly decreased over       time (P = .01). Conclusion Radiology articles featured on the Radiology podcast       had greater median metrics, including downloads, Google Scholar citations,       Dimensions citations, and AAS, compared with nonpodcast articles, suggesting that       podcasts can be an effective method of disseminating and amplifying research       within the field of radiology. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Chu and       Nicola in this issue.

10.1038/s41584-025-01302-0	Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in arthritis: current insights and       future directions.	Karacabeyli D, Lacaille D	Obesity affects nearly one in six adults worldwide. Excess adiposity is a       pro-inflammatory state associated with increased risk of several types of       arthritis, increased arthritis disease activity and/or severity, and poorer       response to certain treatments. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular       disease, the leading cause of death in people with common arthritides such as       osteoarthritis (OA), gout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and axial       spondyloarthritis. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are a       promising therapeutic option for people with arthritis and obesity or type 2       diabetes mellitus owing to their pleiotropic effects, including weight loss,       improved survival and reduced risk of major cardiovascular and renal events. In       vitro and preclinical in vivo experiments in arthritis have uncovered       weight-loss-independent anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties of       GLP-1RAs. In knee OA, clinical data suggest that GLP-1RAs improve pain and       function and reduce the risk of surgical intervention; however, their effects on       OA incidence remain incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that GLP-1RAs do       not directly prevent gout attacks, but are effective in managing cardiometabolic       conditions commonly associated with gout and other arthritides. More research is       needed to clarify the effects of GLP-1RAs on incidence, disease activity, and       progression of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and axial       spondyloarthritis.

10.1016/j.lanmic.2025.101174	Rapid pan-microbial metagenomics for pathogen detection and personalised therapy       in the intensive care unit: a single-centre prospective observational study.	Alcolea-Medina A, Snell LB, Humayun G, Al-Yaakoubi N, Ward D, Alder C, Patel V, Vivian F, Meadows CIS, Wyncoll D, Paul R, Barratt N, Batra R, Edgeworth J, Nebbia G, Whitehorn J	Most clinical metagenomic studies do not provide rapid results,       detect pathogens from all microbial kingdoms, or measure clinical impacts. We       aimed to evaluate the feasibility, performance, and clinical impacts of a rapid       pan-microbial respiratory metagenomic service for patients admitted to intensive       care units (ICUs). This was a single-centre observational study of a       rapid metagenomics service that tests respiratory samples from ICU patients at       Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, London, UK, between Dec 5, 2023, and April 12,       2024. Testing used a previously published pan-microbial metagenomics workflow,       which simultaneously detects bacteria, fungi, and DNA and RNA viruses; provides       same-day preliminary results after 2 h; and provides final results after 24 h.       Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older, admitted to the ICU,       had confirmed respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or advanced       airway support, and had at least one of the following: (1) clinical suspicion of       lower respiratory tract infection based on clinical, biochemical, or radiological       findings, (2) sepsis of unknown origin, and (3) concern from an intensive care       physician regarding inflammatory pathology. Patients with a suspected or       confirmed containment level three organism were excluded. The outcome was       performance characteristics of the metagenomic test compared with routine       diagnostic testing, detection of additional pathogens by metagenomics, change in       antimicrobial prescribing within 24 h of testing, and initiation of       immunomodulation. We processed 114 samples (1-5 per day) from 74       patients (39 [53%] female and 35 [47%] male). 107 (94%) of 114 samples passed       quality control, of which 101 (94%) provided same-day preliminary results.       Bacteria were detected in 45 (43%) of 104 tested specimens, fungal organisms in       17 (16%) of 104 tested specimens, and viruses in 28 (34%) of 83 tested specimens.       Sensitivity in lower respiratory tract samples after 24 h was 97% (95% CI 87-100)       for bacteria, 89% (65-99) for fungi, and 89% (71-98) for viruses, with only one       false positive for bacteria. Metagenomics identified 42 pathogens not detected by       other tests in 32 (30%) of 107 samples. Antimicrobial therapy was changed after       metagenomic results from 30 (28%) of 107 samples: 22 (21%) were de-escalated and       eight (7%) were escalated. Metagenomics contributed to the initiation of       immunomodulation in 15 (20%) of 74 patients for a range of inflammatory       conditions. Pathogens with clinical significance to local infection control or       national public health were found in ten (14%) of 74 patients, including three       invasive Group A streptococci, two parvovirus B19, and one each of HIV-1, measles       virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Mycoplasma       pneumoniae. Respiratory metagenomics for ICU patients showed good       performance and turnaround time, and diverse clinical and public health benefits.       This ability to inform both personalised patient therapy and infectious disease       surveillance needs evaluation in multicentre studies. None.	The Lancet. Microbe	01/10/2025
10.1155/crp/9292002	The Relationship Between the Fibrinogen-to-Albumin Ratio and Short-Term Mortality       in Chinese Patients With Chronic Heart Failure: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.	Guo LL, Liu P, Cai LN, Hu L, Zhou YS	Background: Recent studies have identified an association between the       fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and the prognosis of coronary heart disease;       however, evidence regarding its significance in heart failure patients remains       limited. This study aims to examine the relationship between the FAR and       short-term mortality among individuals with heart failure. Methods: In this       retrospective cohort study, we conducted an analysis of clinical data from       patients with heart failure who were hospitalized at Zigong Fourth People's       Hospital from December 2016 to June 2019. The primary exposure variable was the       FAR, while the outcomes of interest were mortality rates at 28 days and 3 months.       Multivariate logistic regression evaluated FAR's independent association with       short-term mortality, with predictive accuracy assessed via ROC curves and       subgroup consistency through stratified analyses. Furthermore, smooth curve       fitting was utilized to investigate the linear relationship, and a series of       sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of the findings.       Results: The analysis included 1880 participants, of whom 58.1% were females and       54.1% were aged 60-80 years. Our study showed that a one standard deviation rise       in the FAR was linked to a 45% increase in 28-day mortality (OR = 1.45, 95%       CI = 1.02-2.06, p=0.04) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The       28-day mortality rate was markedly elevated in the high FAR group (FAR > 0.126)       compared to the low FAR group (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 1.17-13.82, p=0.028).       Comparable findings were noted at the 3-month mark. There were no significant       interactions found in the subgroup analysis. A linear association was identified       between FAR and short-term mortality. The optimal FAR cutoff value for predicting       28-day mortality was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 59.4%, AUC = 0.654),       while for 3-month mortality, it was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 58.3%,       AUC = 0.647). Sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of our findings.       Conclusion: A positive correlation exists between the FAR and short-term       mortality among Chinese patients with heart failure. These findings underscore       the necessity for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiological       mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions associated with FAR in the       context of heart failure.

10.1038/s41569-025-01211-5	Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiological insights and innovations in patient care.	Omerovic E, Redfors B	Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, was first described in       Japan in the 1990s and presents as acute heart failure caused by transient       contractile dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is not caused by       acute coronary obstruction. Takotsubo syndrome accounts for as much as 2-3% of       suspected coronary syndromes and is considerably more common in women than in       men. In this Review, we discuss the historical background and clinical features       of Takotsubo syndrome and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology. The       hallmark feature of Takotsubo syndrome is transient left ventricular dysfunction       linked to emotional or physical stressors. Despite advances in our understanding       of the clinical presentation and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of       Takotsubo syndrome, this condition continues to challenge our fundamental       understanding of human anatomy and physiology, particularly regarding how acute       emotional and physical stressors can trigger such profound cardiovascular       dysfunction. Although the definitive mechanisms remain elusive, current       hypotheses largely centre on catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system       hyperactivation. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by the Mayo Clinic and       European Society of Cardiology working groups but, in the absence of randomized       controlled clinical trials, no specific treatments for Takotsubo syndrome are       available. In this Review, we highlight the complex pathophysiology of Takotsubo       syndrome, with an emphasis on the interplay between emotional stress and cardiac       health, and call for the development of evidence-based management protocols.

10.1038/s41380-025-03292-7	Transcranial temporal interference stimulation for treating bipolar disorder with       depressive episodes: a feasibility Study.	Zhou H, Wang M, Qi S, Chen Q, Lai J, Wu Z, Liu R, Wang L, Zhou H, Zhang S, Hu S	Bipolar depression (BD-D) is a significant clinical challenge associated with       high disease burden. Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), a       novel and noninvasive approach for targeting deep brain structures, was       investigated for its efficacy and safety in BD-D patients in this trial.       Thirty-six patients were recruited for a single-arm, open-label trial, and 25       completed the 5-day intervention consisting of 10 tTIS sessions targeting the       left nucleus accumbens. Each session lasted 20 min, with a maximum current       intensity of 2 mA and an envelope stimulation frequency of 40 Hz. Significant       symptom reductions were observed following treatment, with mean HAMD-17       scores decreasing from 23.36 to 16.16 (p < 0.0001), MADRS scores from       39.12 to 31.28 (p < 0.01), HAMA scores from 19.68 to 15.44 (p < 0.05), and QIDS       scores from 13.52to 9.68 (p < 0.001). Eleven participants (44.0%) met improvement       criteria and seven (28.0%) achieved response. Cognitive assessments indicated       improvements in memory and executive function, and changes in reward-related       brain activity correlated positively with symptom reduction. Adverse events were       mild, mainly transient scalp discomfort. These findings provide preliminary       evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of tTIS for alleviating depressive       symptoms and cognitive impairments in BD-D.

10.7326/ANNALS-24-01863	Association Between Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Outcomes : A Prospective       Cohort Study.	Jung M, Reisert M, Rieder H, Rospleszcz S, Lu MT, Bamberg F, Raghu VK, Weiss J	Current measures of adiposity have limitations. Artificial       intelligence (AI) models may accurately and efficiently estimate body composition       (BC) from routine imaging. To assess the association of AI-derived BC       compartments from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cardiometabolic outcomes.       Prospective cohort study. UK Biobank (UKB) observational cohort       study. 33 432 UKB participants with no history of diabetes,       myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (mean age, 65.0 years [SD, 7.8]; mean       body mass index [BMI], 25.8 kg/m(2) [SD, 4.2]; 52.8% female) who underwent       whole-body MRI. An AI tool was applied to MRI to derive       3-dimensional (3D) BC measures, including subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT),       visceral adipose tissue (VAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and SM fat fraction (SMFF),       and then calculate their relative distribution. Sex-stratified associations of       these relative compartments with incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and major       adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed using restricted cubic       splines. Adipose tissue compartments and SMFF increased and SM decreased       with age. After adjustment for age, smoking, and hypertension, greater adiposity       and lower SM proportion were associated with higher incidence of DM and MACE       after a median follow-up of 4.2 years in sex-stratified analyses; however, after       additional adjustment for BMI and waist circumference (WC), only elevated VAT       proportions and high SMFF (top fifth percentile in the cohort for each) were       associated with increased risk for DM (respective adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs],       2.16 [95% CI, 1.59 to 2.94] and 1.27 [CI, 0.89 to 1.80] in females and 1.84 [CI,       1.48 to 2.27] and 1.84 [CI, 1.43 to 2.37] in males) and MACE (1.37 [CI, 1.00 to       1.88] and 1.72 [CI, 1.23 to 2.41] in females and 1.22 [CI, 0.99 to 1.50] and 1.25       [CI, 0.98 to 1.60] in males). In addition, in males only, those in the bottom       fifth percentile of SM proportion had increased risk for DM (aHR for the bottom       fifth percentile of the cohort, 1.96 [CI, 1.45 to 2.65]) and MACE (aHR, 1.55 [CI,       1.15 to 2.09]). Results may not be generalizable to non-Whites or       people outside the United Kingdom. Artificial intelligence-derived BC       proportions were strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk, but after BMI and       WC were accounted for, only VAT proportion and SMFF (both sexes) and SM       proportion (males only) added prognostic information.

10.1002/jmv.1890420413	Acute sporadic hepatitis E in Kuwait.	Koshy A, Richards AL, al-Mufti S, Grover S, Shabrawy MA, Pacsa A, al-Anezi H, al-Nakib B, Burans J, Carl M, et al.	Fifty-seven adult patients with acute hepatitis and 34 comparison patients       without liver disease were evaluated using a newly developed Western blot assay       for IgM antibody to hepatitis E virus. The mean age of patients with hepatitis       was 32 years (range, 18-55 years); 88% were male. Among patients with acute       hepatitis, hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgM positive) was diagnosed in two (4%),       hepatitis B (anti-HBc IgM positive) in three (5%), and hepatitis E (anti-HEV IgM       positive) in 34 (60%). One hepatitis patient had CMV IgM, another had EBV IgM,       and 16 others (28%) were negative for all serologic markers of acute viral       hepatitis. No patient with acute hepatitis A or B and none of the comparison       patients without acute hepatitis had anti-HEV IgM. All but one case of acute       hepatitis E were found among expatriates of Asian origin, and acute hepatitis E       was associated significantly with recent travel to the Indian subcontinent. These       data suggest that acute hepatitis E is common among foreign workers in Kuwait but       that little HEV transmission is occurring directly in Kuwait.

We developed TriVerity, which uses isothermal       amplification of 29 mRNAs and machine learning algorithms on the Myrna instrument       to determine likelihoods of bacterial infection, viral infection and need for       critical care interventions within 7 days. To validate TriVerity, the       SEPSIS-SHIELD study enrolled 1,222 patients with clinically adjudicated infection       status and need for critical care intervention within 7 days as endpoints. The       TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores had higher accuracy than C-reactive protein,       procalcitonin or white blood cell count for the diagnosis of bacterial infection       with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.83, and viral       infection (AUROC = 0.91). The TriVerity Severity score had an AUROC of 0.78 for       predicting illness severity and allowed reclassification of risk for critical       care interventions compared to clinical assessment (quick Sequential Organ       Failure Assessment) alone. Each of the three scores had rule-in specificity >92%       and rule-out sensitivity >95%. Comparison of antibiotics administration at       presentation with post-follow-up adjudication found that TriVerity could       potentially reduce false positives and false negatives for inappropriate       antibiotics use by 60-70%. Further clinical testing in an interventional setting       is needed to prove actionability and clinical benefit of TriVerity.	Nature medicine	30/09/2025

These large end-stage species are formed by smaller soluble protein       nanoscale assemblies, often termed oligomers, which are proposed as early drivers       of pathogenesis. Until now, this hypothesis has remained controversial, at least       in part because it has not been possible to directly visualize nanoscale       assemblies in human brain tissue. Here we present Advanced Sensing of       Aggregates-Parkinson's Disease, an imaging method to generate large-scale       α-synuclein aggregate maps in post-mortem human brain tissue. We combined       autofluorescence suppression with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, which       together enable the detection of nanoscale α-synuclein aggregates. To demonstrate       the use of this platform, we analysed ~1.2 million nanoscale aggregates from the       anterior cingulate cortex in human post-mortem brain samples from patients with       PD and healthy controls. Our data reveal a disease-specific shift in a       subpopulation of nanoscale assemblies that represent an early feature of the       proteinopathy that underlies PD. We anticipate that quantitative information       about this distribution provided by Advanced Sensing of Aggregates-Parkinson's       Disease will enable mechanistic studies to reveal the pathological processes       caused by α-synuclein aggregation.

10.1183/13993003.01126-2025	European Respiratory Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of       Adult Bronchiectasis.

Exacerbations and daily symptoms have the largest impact on patients and       healthcare systems, and they are the key focus of treatments. Current practice is       heterogeneous globally, and bronchiectasis has historically been a neglected       disease. Here, we present evidence-based international guidelines for the       management of adults with bronchiectasis. A European Respiratory Society       (ERS) Task Force, comprising global experts, a methodologist, and patient       representatives, developed clinical practice guidelines in accordance with ERS       methodology and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development       and Evaluations) approach. Systematic literature searches, data extraction, and       meta-analysis were performed to generate evidence tables, and recommendations       were formulated using the evidence-to-decision framework. A total of 8 PICO       (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) questions and 3 narrative questions       were developed. The Task Force recommendations include strong       recommendations in favour of airway clearance techniques for most patients with       bronchiectasis and pulmonary rehabilitation for those with impaired exercise       capacity. We issue a strong recommendation for the use of long-term macrolide       treatment for patients at high risk of exacerbations and a strong recommendation       in favour of long-term inhaled antibiotics in patients with chronic Pseudomonas       aeruginosa infection at high risk of exacerbation. Conditional recommendations       support the use of eradication treatment or mucoactive drugs in specific       circumstances. We suggest not to routinely use long term oral, non-macrolide       antibiotic treatment or inhaled corticosteroids. Additional guidance is also       provided on testing for underlying causes, managing exacerbations, and managing       the deteriorating patient. The ERS bronchiectasis guidelines provide       an evidence-based framework for optimal management of adults with bronchiectasis       and serve as a benchmark for evaluating the quality of care. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for the management       of bronchiectasis in adults provide evidence-based recommendations for the care       of people with clinically significant bronchiectasis, defined by the presence of       permanent dilatation of the bronchi evident on chest CT scan, along with       characteristic clinical symptoms. [1] These guidelines are intended for all       healthcare professionals involved in the care of adults with bronchiectasis, as       well as for policymakers, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies.       Bronchiectasis is a complex and heterogeneous disease; therefore, no guideline       can be entirely comprehensive or replace clinical judgement. All guideline       recommendations must be interpreted within the specific clinical context in which       they are applied. Separate ERS guidelines for the management of bronchiectasis in       children exist [2]. Bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) has a distinct       evidence base; therefore, guidance for the management of CF is provided       elsewhere. [3] Some bronchiectasis-associated conditions also have distinct       guidelines for investigation and management, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia       (PCD) [4], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) [5] and non-tuberculous       mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease [6]. While the present guidelines apply for       these conditions, they should be interpreted in conjunction with the relevant       syndrome-specific recommendations.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157312	Zhenqi Fuzheng Granule targets the SCFAs-GPR109A axis to enhance PD-1 antibody       efficacy via immunometabolic remodeling in colorectal cancer.	Guo L, Yi J, Zhang A, Zheng X, Wang M, Yang F, Kong X, Meng J	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly PD-1 antibodies,       represent a breakthrough in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. However, their       clinical efficacy remains limited by tumour-induced immunosuppression.       Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has attracted growing interest as a potential       adjuvant to immunotherapy. Zhenqi Fuzheng Granule (ZQFZ) is a clinically approved       herbal prescription widely used as an adjuvant therapy for CRC, yet its       mechanistic underpinnings remain elusive. To investigate how ZQFZ       improves the efficacy in CRC, with emphasis on gut microbiota modulation, SCFAs       production, and downstream immunometabolic pathways involving GPR109A, and       confirms that butyrate plays an important role in colorectal cancer inhibition.       Phytochemical analysis of ZQFZ was conducted using LC-MS/MS and       UPLC-MS/MS, identifying and quantifying seven major compounds. In vivo       experiments, AOM/DSS-induced CRC mouse models were treated with ZQFZ, PD-1       antibody, or their combination. Tumour progression, body weight, and survival       were monitored. Gut microbial composition and colonic SCFAs levels were assessed       via 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography. RT-qPCR was employed to validate       the expression of key genes associated with the GPR109A/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling       pathway. Molecular changes in the GPR109A/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway were evaluated       through Western blotting, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Immune cell       infiltration and phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Molecular docking       and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to predict the binding affinity       and structural stability between GPR109A and AKT1. The interactions between       GPR109A and AKT1, as well as between butyrate and GPR109A, were further validated       in vitro using microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays. To evaluate the microbial       basis of ZQFZ activity, antibiotic-pretreated mice received ZQFZ-derived fecal       microbiota transplantation (FMT). In vitro experiments, to investigate the       mechanism by which sodium butyrate (NaB), the major gut microbial metabolite of       ZQFZ, inhibits glycolysis in colorectal cancer under hypoxic conditions, CCK-8       assays, flow cytometry, lactate measurements, and Western blotting were performed       to assess cell viability, apoptosis, lactate production, and the expression of       AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α and glycolysis-related proteins. LC-MS/MS profiling       identified multiple bioactive constituents in ZQFZ. Targeted UPLC-MS/MS       quantification revealed that the formulation contained Adenosine (0.87mg/g),       Salidroside (0.11 mg/g), Astragaloside IV (0.07 mg/g), Calycosin (0.03 mg/g),       Formononetin (6.7 μg /g), Chlorogenic acid (1.4 μg/g), Apigenin (0.5 μg/g). In       vivo studies, both ZQFZ and PD-1 antibody inhibited tumour growth, with the       combination treatment exerting the most pronounced antitumour effects. ZQFZ       reshaped the gut microbiota, increased the levels of short-chain fatty acids       (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, and activated the GPR109A pathway, leading to       downregulation of the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling axis, suppression of HK2       expression and lactate production, and consequent inhibition of glycolysis.       Immune remodeling was also observed, including reduced infiltration of       myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), polarization of macrophages toward the       M1 phenotype, restoration of the CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cell ratio, and modulation of serum       cytokines including upregulation of IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ, along with       downregulation of IL-4 and IL-10. ZQFZ-derived FMT significantly inhibited tumour       growth, suppressed glycolysis-related markers (PKM2, GLUT1, HIF-1α, LDHA), and       remodeled the immune microenvironment by reducing MDSCs and enhancing M1       macrophages and CD8⁺ T cell infiltration. In hypoxia-mimicking in vitro       experiments, sodium butyrate (NaB), the principal gut microbial metabolite of       ZQFZ, suppressed colorectal cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis. Through       activation of GPR109A, NaB inhibited the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway and       glycolysis-related enzymes, reduced lactate production, and further suppressed       glycolysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggested a stable       interaction between GPR109A and AKT1, which was confirmed in vitro by MST showing       high-affinity binding (Kd=74.5 ± 20.8 nM); MST also verified moderate-affinity       binding between GPR109A and sodium butyrate (Kd=43.3 ± 6.5 μM), supporting a dual       interaction model wherein butyrate activates GPR109A, which in turn directly       binds AKT1 to inhibit downstream glycolytic signaling. This study       uncovers a novel integrated mechanism whereby ZQFZ enhances PD-1 antibody       efficacy via the gut microbiota-SCFAs-GPR109A axis, and NaB-mediated glycolysis       inhibition under hypoxia further confirms its immunometabolic mechanism against       CRC.

10.1093/ndt/gfaf203	Teneligliptin and empagliflozin attenuate ferroptosis-mediated acute tubular       injury.	Ema C, Iwakura T, Tsuji N, Nakayama Y, Tsuchida M, Kitamura A, Katahashi N, Ishigaki S, Isobe S, Fujikura T, Ohashi N, Kato A, Sugimoto K, Yasuda H	Ferroptosis is a key mechanism of tubular cell death       in acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in folic acid- and glycerol-induced       models. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)       inhibitors exhibit renoprotective effects beyond glucose lowering, and emerging       evidence suggests both may suppress ferroptosis. We hypothesized that       teneligliptin (TG) and empagliflozin (EMPA) protect tubular cells from       ferroptosis-mediated injury by reducing lipid peroxidation. HK-2 cells       were pretreated with inhibitors of apoptosis (z-VAD-FMK), necroptosis       (necrostatin-1s), or ferroptosis (ferrostatin-1), and then exposed to folic acid       or myoglobin. The effects of TG on erastin-, folic acid-, and myoglobin-induced       injury, and of EMPA on erastin- and myoglobin-induced injury, were evaluated       using cell viability and lipid peroxidation assays. In vivo, TG was tested in       folic acid- and glycerol-induced AKI models, and EMPA in the glycerol-induced AKI       model. Renal function, tubular injury, inflammation, and glutathione peroxidase 4       (GPX4) expression were assessed. Localization of DPP4, NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1),       NOX4, and megalin in the kidney was analyzed by immunostaining. Ferrostatin-1, but not z-VAD-FMK or necrostatin-1s, prevented folic acid- and       myoglobin-induced cell death in vitro. Both TG and EMPA significantly reduced       erastin-induced cell death and lipid peroxidation. TG also attenuated cell death       and lipid peroxidation in folic acid- and myoglobin-induced injury. EMPA improved       viability and reduced lipid peroxidation in the myoglobin model. In vivo, TG       improved renal function, reduced tubular damage and inflammation, and preserved       GPX4 expression. EMPA showed similar protective effects in       rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI. DPP4 co-localized with NOX4, but showed no       co-localization with NOX1. TG treatment disrupted the co-localization of NOX4       with DPP4. TG and EMPA attenuate tubular cell death and kidney injury       in ferroptosis-mediated AKI models, potentially through the reduction of lipid       peroxidation. These findings highlight ferroptosis suppression as a potential       mechanism underlying their renoprotective effects in AKI prevention.

10.3389/fendo.2025.1625973	Global, regional, and national burden of type 2 diabetes-related diabetic kidney       disease attributable to low physical activity from 1990 to 2021: a systematic       analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 with predictions to 2050.	Wang M, Yan R, Xia W, Gao Y, Liu Y, Bao L, Luo H, E J, Wang H, Li B, Zheng Y	Low physical activity (LPA) significantly heightens the       susceptibility of both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic renal disease.       Nearly half of population diagnosed with T2DM globally worsen into diabetic       kidney disease (DKD). Focusing on physically inactive populations, we aimed to       comprehensively evaluate the trends over time and regional changes in       T2DM-associated DKD attributable to LPA burden. We utilized data of the       2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to initially assess the worldwide       effects of T2DM-associated DKD attributable to LPA by computing the numbers and       age-standardized rates (ASRs) of death, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs),       years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs), categorized by       subtypes in 2021. Linear regression model was applied to analyze the illness       burden from 1990 to 2021. Furthermore, cluster analysis was performed to assess       the regional differences in disease burden across GBD regions. Lastly, to       forecast the illness burden for the next 25 years, we utilized the autoregressive       Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Excess Risk (ER) models. In 2021,       the fatalities attributed to T2DM-related DKD attributable to LPA amounted to       30835 (95%12346-51646) cases, with 698484 (95%275039-1158032) DALYs. The       ASRs of death and DALYs were 0.38 (95%0.15-0.63) and 8.19 (95%3.21-13.6)       per 100000 individuals, respectively. Between 1990 and 2021, there was a notable       escalation in deaths, DALYs, YLDs, and YLLs, as well as their ASRs. The highest       burden was observed among males, older adults (aged 70 years and above), and       middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Significant differences were noted in the       disease burden among various regions and countries as defined by the GBD study.       Predictive analyses indicate a continued escalation of this burden by the year       2050. The global impact of DKD attributable to LPA remains       considerable, with significant disparities noted across different genders, ages,       and regions. To mitigate this burden, it is crucial to implement effective       interventions aimed at addressing physical inactivity, specifically designed for       targeted demographic groups.

Dühring S, Germerodt S, Skerka C, Zipfel PF, Dandekar T, Schuster S	The diploid, polymorphic yeast Candida albicans is one of the most important       human pathogenic fungi. C. albicans can grow, proliferate and coexist as a       commensal on or within the human host for a long time. However, alterations in       the host environment can render C. albicans virulent. In this review, we describe       the immunological cross-talk between C. albicans and the human innate immune       system. We give an overview in form of pairs of human defense strategies       including immunological mechanisms as well as general stressors such as nutrient       limitation, pH, fever etc. and the corresponding fungal response and evasion       mechanisms. Furthermore, Computational Systems Biology approaches to model and       investigate these complex interactions are highlighted with a special focus on       game-theoretical methods and agent-based models. An outlook on interesting       questions to be tackled by Systems Biology regarding entangled defense and       evasion mechanisms is given.	Frontiers in microbiology	01/01/2015
10.1186/s13024-025-00892-3	Molecular hallmarks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal resilience to       Alzheimer's disease.	Castanho I, Naderi Yeganeh P, Boix CA, Morgan SL, Mathys H, Prokopenko D, White B, Soto LM, Pegoraro G, Shah S, Ploumakis A, Kalavros N, Bennett DA, Lange C, Kim DY, Bertram L, Tsai LH, Kellis M, Tanzi RE, Hide W	A significant proportion of individuals maintain cognition despite       extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience.       Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals could       reveal therapeutic targets for AD. This study defines molecular and       cellular signatures of cognitive resilience by integrating bulk RNA and       single-cell transcriptomic data with genetics across multiple brain regions. We       analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging       Project (ROSMAP), including bulk RNA sequencing (n = 631 individuals) and       multiregional single-nucleus RNA sequencing (n = 48 individuals). Subjects were       categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on β-amyloid and tau pathology,       and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations       using whole-genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling,       and cellular composition. Transcriptomics and polygenic risk analysis       position resilience as an intermediate AD state. Only GFAP and KLF4 expression       distinguished resilience from controls at tissue level, whereas differential       expression of genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling       differentiated AD and resilient brains. At the cellular level, resilience was       characterized by broad downregulation of LINGO1 expression and reorganization of       chaperone pathways, specifically downregulation of Hsp90 and upregulation of       Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. MEF2C, ATP8B1, and RELN       emerged as key markers of resilient neurons. Excitatory neuronal subtypes in the       entorhinal cortex (ATP8B+ and MEF2C(high)) exhibited unique resilience signaling       through activation of neurotrophin (BDNF-NTRK2, modulated by LINGO1) and       angiopoietin (ANGPT2-TEK) pathways. MEF2C+ inhibitory neurons were       over-represented in resilient brains, and the expression of genes associated with       rare genetic variants revealed vulnerable somatostatin (SST) cortical       interneurons that survive in AD resilience. The maintenance of       excitatory-inhibitory balance emerges as a key characteristic of resilience.       We have defined molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive       resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms       include preserved neuronal function, balanced network activity, and activation of       neurotrophic survival signaling. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear       to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of       vulnerable interneurons likely provides compensation against AD-associated       hyperexcitability. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective       mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD.	Molecular neurodegeneration	01/10/2025
10.1084/jem.20080340	A point mutation in the murine Hem1 gene reveals an essential role for       Hematopoietic protein 1 in lymphopoiesis and innate immunity.	Park H, Staehling-Hampton K, Appleby MW, Brunkow ME, Habib T, Zhang Y, Ramsdell F, Liggitt HD, Freie B, Tsang M, Carlson G, Friend S, Frevert C, Iritani BM	Hem1 (Hematopoietic protein 1) is a hematopoietic cell-specific member of the Hem       family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. Orthologues of Hem1 in Dictyostelium       discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are essential for       cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis.       However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem1 are not known. Using a chemical       mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell       functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation in the Hem1 gene. Hem1       deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in       lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory       WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted in Hem1-deficient mice at       the CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (double positive) cell stages,       whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem1-deficient neutrophils       fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient in their       ability to phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such       as Th1 differentiation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent       transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally in Hem1-deficient       mice, whereas the production of Th17 cells are enhanced. These results       demonstrate that Hem1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function,       and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal       reorganization, whereas NF-kappaB-dependent transcription proceeds independently       of Hem1 and F-actin polymerization.

10.1016/j.jhep.2025.08.020	Multicenter phase II trial of lenvatinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular       carcinoma after progression on first-line atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.	Kim HD, Sym SJ, Chon HJ, Kim M, Kang JH, Ryoo BY, Lee CK, Hong J, Ryu H, Bae WK, Kim H, Kim H, Kim JW, Kim TY, Yoo C	BACKGROUND & Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo-bev) is the global       standard first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).       However, most patients eventually experience disease progression and optimal       second-line strategies after atezo-bev failure remain unclear. Prospective       evidence supporting multikinase inhibitors in this context is limited. This investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-arm study (KCSG HB23-04)       enrolled 50 patients with uHCC who progressed after first-line atezo-bev across       13 sites between August 2023 and May 2024. Patients received second-line       lenvatinib at 12 mg or 8 mg daily, depending on body weight, until disease       progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free       survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate,       disease control rate, duration of response, and safety. Of the 50       patients enrolled, the median age was 66 years, and 72% had a viral etiology. The       median time to progression with atezo-bev was 6.5 months. During a median       follow-up of 12.6 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.4 months       (95% CI 4.2-7.1) (>4.5 months), meeting the prespecified primary endpoint. Median       overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.1-NR). The objective response rate was       14.0%, and the disease control rate was 82.0%. The median duration of response       was 9.4 months. Survival outcomes were different according to the objective       response with lenvatinib, but not by time to progression on atezo-bev or HCC       etiology. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (42.0%), hypothyroidism       (32.0%), and anorexia (30.0%). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 46.0% of       patients. Lenvatinib demonstrated promising efficacy and a       manageable safety profile as a second-line treatment for patients with HCC       progressing on atezo-bev. These findings offer prospective evidence supporting       lenvatinib as a viable treatment option in the post-atezo-bev context. This study provides the first prospective evidence for the use of       lenvatinib as a second-line therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular       carcinoma who have progressed after first-line atezo-bev treatment. The findings       highlight the potential of lenvatinib as a viable therapeutic option in a       clinical setting where few alternatives are available. The results are       particularly important for healthcare professionals managing unresectable       hepatocellular carcinoma, as they provide a robust framework for considering       lenvatinib in second-line treatment protocols. Given the manageable safety       profile, these findings could be translated into practical recommendations for       clinical practice, offering physicians a treatment strategy to improve patient       outcomes following atezo-bev failure while guiding future research into       combination therapies and broader patient populations.

10.1038/s41598-025-16917-2	Systematic review and meta-analysis of antioxidants with or without exercise       training improving muscle condition in older adults.	Wang Y, He Z, Long C, Li Y, Yuan Y, Huang T	Oxidative stress and physical inactivity are regarded as important mechanisms       contributing to muscle loss. However, the efficacy of antioxidants and their       potential synergy with exercise training remain controversial for older       population. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of antioxidants, either       combined with or without exercise, on improving muscle strength, mass, and       physical performance in older adults. We conducted a comprehensive search of the       PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases to identify randomized controlled trials       (RCTs) on muscle condition in subjects aged 55 years or older. The search period       covered from the inception of each database until June 10, 2024. A total of 39       RCTs involving 1714 participants were included. The meta-analysis presented that       antioxidants alone could enhance muscle strength in 1 repetition maximum (RM) in       leg press and physical function in the older population. Exercise alone could       increase the walking distance of 6 min walk more than antioxidants alone. The       combination of antioxidants and exercise further improved 1RM in leg press, usual       walking speed and walking distance of 6 min walk compared to antioxidants alone.       Additionally, this combination enhanced handgrip strength, 1RM in leg press and       walking distance of 6 min walk more than exercise alone. This meta-analysis       demonstrated that antioxidants alone had positive effects on muscle condition in       older individuals. However, the combination of antioxidants and exercise was more       effective than either intervention alone in improving muscle strength and       physical function among the older adults.

10.1186/s12884-025-08169-9	Comprehensive identification of immune-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets       in preeclampsia: integrative bioinformatics and experimental validation.	Wu X, Li X, Wu Y, Yang H, Wu J, He L	"Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious hypertensive complication during       pregnancy characterized by immune dysregulation and vascular dysfunction,       however, the precise molecular mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies       remain unclear. This study focused on identifying immune-related differentially       expressed genes (IRDEGs) in PE, investigate their biological significance and       regulatory networks, and establish robust diagnostic models through integrated       bioinformatics and experimental analyses. Gene expression data from the       GSE75010 dataset were analyzed utilizing the R-based ""limma"" package to determine       differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were intersected with immune-related       genes (IRGs) to obtain IRDEGs. Functional enrichment was assessed using Gene       Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease       Ontology (DO) analyses. Hub genes were identified via Random Forest (RF) and       LASSO regression algorithms, and their diagnostic performance was assessed via       receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation in both training       (GSE75010) and validation (GSE44711) cohorts. Immune cell composition and its       association with hub genes were explored using CIBERSORT. Regulatory networks,       including protein-protein interaction (PPI), mRNA-miRNA and mRNA-TF interactions,       were constructed using ENCORI and CHIPBase databases. Analysis of potential       pharmaceutical-gene interactions was performed via DGIdb platform interrogation,       followed by experimental validation in placental tissue and trophoblast cells.       We identified 354 DEGs, including 49 IRDEGs (25 upregulated and 24       downregulated). Enrichment evaluation demonstrated that IRDEGs were associated       with PI3K-AKT signaling, chemokine signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor       interaction. DO analysis linked IRDEGs to PE, cardiovascular diseases, and       reproductive disorders. Four hub genes (FLT1, PIK3CB, KLRD1, and APLN) were       identified as PE biomarkers based on their connectivity in the PPI network and       performance in machine learning models. The RF-based diagnostic model       demonstrated excellent discrimination ability with AUCs of 0.9468 (training       cohort) and 0.9844 (validation cohort). Immune infiltration analysis revealed       higher levels of eosinophils, plasma cells, and CD8 + T cells in PE, while       monocytes and M2 macrophages were reduced. Notably, hub genes showed distinct       correlations with immune cell subtypes, such as the positive association observed       between FLT1 and plasma cells, contrasting with the inverse relationship       documented between APLN and CD8 + T cells. Network analysis identified 128       mRNA-miRNA and 31 mRNA-TF interaction pairs. Drug-gene interaction analysis       showed cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as aspirin, targeted APLN, while TNF-α       inhibitors, such as etanercept, targeted KLRD1. Experimental validation confirmed       consistent expression trends across clinical specimens and in vitro models: FLT1       and PIK3CB were significantly upregulated while KLRD1 and APLN were significantly       downregulated in both preeclamptic placental tissues and hypoxia-exposed       trophoblast cells. Our study identified four hub IRDEGs that may       serve as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets for PE. These       findings suggest an important role of immune dysregulation in PE pathogenesis and       offer new perspectives for treatment strategies. By integrating computational       predictions with experimental evidence, our work contributes to the foundation       for future clinical applications, though further research including early-stage       PE is needed to validate these observations."

Cao L, Yang J, Liu Y, Chen X, Shi Y, Zhao Y, Zhang Y, Chen J, Li B, Wen W, Chen L, Peng B, Huang L, Sun Y, Zhou L, Rees MG, Ronan MM, Roth JA, Guo Z, Xing J, Zhu G, Wang Y, Jiang B, Lu J, Zhao K, Lu W	The TEA/ATSS (TEAD) family of transcription factors are key effectors of the       Hippo pathway, exerting their function through interactions with the coactivators       YAP and TAZ. Over the past five years, the development of YAP-TEAD disruptors has       emerged as a central focus of both academic and industrial efforts aimed at       targeting the Hippo pathway for cancer therapy. In this study, the discovery and       comprehensive characterization of KG-FP-003, a potent, selective, and durable       TEAD degrader is reported. KG-FP-003 exhibits superior activity compared to the       lipid-binding pocket (LBP) inhibitor MYF-03-176 and the TEAD-YAP protein-protein       interaction (PPI) inhibitor IAG933, efficiently degrading all TEAD isoforms at       low nanomolar concentrations in a ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent       manner. This degradation translates into more robust and sustained therapeutic       responses both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, barcoded cell line screening       revealed elevated sensitivity in several cancer types, including endometrial       carcinoma, glioblastoma, ovarian epithelial tumors, and osteosarcoma. These       findings position KG-FP-003 as a compelling lead candidate for TEAD       isoform-selective therapies and underscore its potential utility beyond       Hippo-dysregulated mesothelioma.

10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease: 2025 ACC Scientific Statement: A Report       of the American College of Cardiology.	Mensah GA, Arnold N, Prabhu SD, Ridker PM, Welty FK	The crucial role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of       cardiovascular disease (CVD) has recently gained increased attention. In       particular, residual inflammation, measured with high-sensitivity C-reactive       protein (hsCRP) remains strongly predictive of recurrent events, even in       statin-treated patients. Similarly, elevated hsCRP in apparently healthy       individuals identifies a higher-risk group in whom statin therapy significantly       reduces the risk of first major CVD events even if LDL-cholesterol is normal.       This report provides an updated understanding of the role of chronic, low-grade       inflammation in CVD and highlights new seminal research findings, especially in       atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pericarditis.       Consensus recommendations are summarized for screening, evaluation, and CVD risk       assessment; inflammatory biomarkers in cardiovascular imaging; inflammation       inhibition in behavioral and lifestyle risks; and anti-inflammatory approaches in       primary and secondary prevention as well as in heart failure and other CVDs. This       report also addresses current challenges and future opportunities. For example,       it cautions that not all trials of anti-inflammatory therapy in secondary       prevention have been successful and such trial evidence is needed before broad       recommendations for other agents can be made. Additionally, in successful trials,       the interplay between inflammation and key physiological systems often remains       incompletely examined. Another promising area of research is the role that novel       special pro-resolving bioactive lipid molecules play in promoting the resolution       of inflammation and CVD risk reduction. In aggregate, the evidence linking       inflammation with atherosclerotic CVD is no longer exploratory but is compelling       and clinically actionable. The time for taking action has now arrived.

10.3389/fneur.2025.1673321	Determining the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of menstrual       migraine: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.	Wu Q, Fan L, Wu D, Gao H, Han D, Hu H, Qian L	Menstrual migraine (MM) is a common type of headache linked to       hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, remains challenging to treat       due to the limited efficacy of current therapies. While acupuncture shows       potential as a therapeutic option for MM, the existing evidence does not clearly       support its routine clinical use. This protocol for a systematic review (SR) and       meta-analysis seeks to gather and evaluate recent clinical evidence regarding the       effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in treating MM. A comprehensive       search was conducted across multiple databases from their inception to April       2025, including PubMed, Medline, Ovid, Embase, ScienceDirect, the Chinese       National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, the Chinese Biomedical       Literature (CBM) database, and the VIP Database. This was complemented by regular       updates from trial registries such as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled       Trials (CENTRAL) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform       (ICTRP), which target unpublished and ongoing randomized controlled trials       (RCTs). Eligible studies were RCTs comparing acupuncture with Western medicine,       herbal remedies, sham acupuncture, or no intervention for the management of MM.       Primary outcomes included the pain intensity [Visual Analog Scale (VAS)], the       frequency of migraine attacks (FM), and duration of migraine (DM). Secondary       outcomes encompassed response rate, Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), the Menstrual       Headache Index (MHI), the serum levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and adverse       events. Analyses involved meta-analysis, subgroup comparisons, publication bias       detection, sensitivity testing, risk-of-bias evaluations, and profiling of       adverse events. The quality of evidence was judged according to the Grading of       Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.       A total of 39 RCTs comprising 2,584 participants were included. Compared       with control interventions, acupuncture significantly reduced VAS scores,       decreased the frequency and duration of migraine attacks, and improved response       rates, as well as HIT-6 and MHI scores. Additionally, acupuncture was associated       with increased serum 5-HT levels. Meta-analytic findings indicated that       acupuncture demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the treatment of MM.       Findings suggest that acupuncture for MM produced the most notable       reductions in migraine severity. Nevertheless, the GRADE assessment indicated low       overall certainty of the evidence, with considerable heterogeneity present in       multiple pooled analyses. Therefore, well-designed, large-scale RCTs are urgently       required to strengthen the evidence base. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42022367446.	Frontiers in neurology	01/01/2025
10.1186/s11658-025-00785-9	RSL3 promotes PARP1 apoptotic functions by distinct mechanisms during       ferroptosis.	Chen D, Xie F, Mo Y, Qin D, Zheng B, Chen L	The classical ferroptosis activator RSL3 targets enzymes with       nucleophilic active sites, primarily acting on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to       trigger ferroptosis. Recent studies identify RSL3 as a potential pro-apoptotic       agent. However, the mechanism by which RSL3 induces apoptosis during ferroptosis       remains elusive. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) determines cell fate in       response to DNA damage, where its loss or cleavage by activated caspase-3 induces       apoptosis to attenuate tumor progression. We elucidate a novel mechanism       underlying PARP1 regulation, encompassing both its caspase-dependent cleavage and       full-length depletion during RSL3-mediated ferroptosis-apoptosis crosstalk.       To investigate the role of RSL3 during ferroptosis, we treated several       cancer cells of different histological types with varying doses of RSL3 to induce       apoptosis. The regulatory proteins of PARP1 were analyzed using real-time       quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. The       N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification level of PARP1 was determined by m(6)A       RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR analysis. Additionally, an RNA       immunoprecipitation (RIP)-qPCR assay was performed to identify the target protein       of the m(6)A site of PARP1. Furthermore, we established a mouse xenograft model       of PARP inhibitor (PARPi)-resistant cells to analyze the effect of RSL3 on       PARPi-resistant tumor growth. RSL3 triggers two parallel apoptotic       pathways via increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during       ferroptosis: (1) caspase-dependent PARP1 cleavage and (2) DNA damage-dependent       apoptosis resulting from reduced full-length PARP1. The latter occurs through       inhibition of METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification and subsequent suppression of       PARP1 translation. Moreover, we found that RSL3 retains pro-apoptotic functions       in PARPi-resistant cells and effectively inhibits PARPi-resistant xenograft tumor       growth in vivo. RSL3 orchestrates ferroptosis-apoptosis crosstalk       via PARP1, demonstrating therapeutic potential against tumorigenesis,       particularly in PARPi-resistant malignancies.

Cruz JPS, Genis-Mendoza AD, López-Narváez ML, González-Castro TB, Juárez-Rojop IE, Tovilla-Zárate CA, Nicolini H	(1) Background: health care workers, particularly nurses, have been regularly       assaulted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: to evaluate the prevalence and       location of assaults against nursing personnel in Latin America, and to determine       predictor factors for aggression against nurses. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional       online survey was answered by 374 nurses working in health care during the       COVID-19 pandemic. The aggression against nurses was estimated using the       Victimization Scale. (3) Results: A total of 288 nurses were included in this       study. The victimization scale showed that 52.1% of nurses have suffered       aggression by the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Males were       more likely to be attacked than females (p < 0.05). Additionally, males were       attacked more frequently on public transport (x(2) = 6.72, p = 0.01). The home       neighborhood and markets were other locations with a higher risk of being       assaulted (3.39, 1.53-7.50). (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that       nurses in Latin America who work during the COVID-19 pandemic and social       isolation have been frequently assaulted by the general public. Males are more       frequently attacked than females and the main places of aggression are public       transportation, their home neighborhood and supermarkets. Implications for       nursing practice: it is necessary to create and implement protocols and       guidelines to support nursing personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study       was retrospectively registered at the Juarez Autonomous University of Tabasco       (103/CIPDACS/2020) on the (08/2020).	Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)	07/10/2023
10.1038/s41579-025-01242-2	Clostridioides difficile pathogenesis and control.	Chilton CH, Viprey V, Normington C, Moura IB, Buckley AM, Freeman J, Davies K, Wilcox MH	Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) continues to be a notable burden       worldwide, both in terms of patient mortality and morbidity, and the economic       costs associated with treatment, diagnosis and management. The epidemiology of C.       difficile has changed markedly over the decades, with high CDI rates driven by       clinical pressures exacerbated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome       coronavirus 2 pandemic, antibiotic resistance and selective pressures caused by       antimicrobial use. C. difficile is challenging to diagnose and treat as it forms       spores and can persist asymptomatically within the gut. Some strains express       multiple virulence factors, including adhesins and toxins. The gut microbiota is       crucially important in CDI, as a healthy microbiota is resistant to colonization       with C. difficile. Dysbiosis, often caused by antimicrobial exposure, enables C.       difficile spores to germinate and produce toxin, causing symptoms that can range       from mild diarrhoea to fulminant colitis and death. This Review describes changes       in epidemiology and effects on diagnosis, discusses recent breakthroughs in the       understanding of pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance and explores the role of       microbiota dysbiosis in CDI and novel microbiota therapies in CDI treatment.

10.1038/s41572-025-00654-x	Listeriosis.	Disson O, Charlier C, Pérot P, Leclercq A, Paz RN, Kathariou S, Tsai YH, Lecuit M	Listeriosis is a serious food-borne bacterial infection caused by Listeria       monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial species       that can replicate inside human cells, as well as thrive in a variety of       environments, including soil, decaying vegetation, animal intestines and foods       such as unpasteurized dairy products, soft cheese, raw meat, fish, seafood,       vegetables and fruits. Clinically, L. monocytogenes can cause gastroenteritis in       healthy individuals or serious invasive infections in at-risk populations. For       example, maternal-fetal infections during pregnancy can lead to adverse pregnancy       outcomes. In the elderly and immunosuppressed, listeriosis can cause septicaemia       and central nervous system infections (also known as neurolisteriosis) with high       mortality and risk of long-term sequelae. Genomic studies have identified four       lineages of L. monocytogenes, with lineage I comprising the most virulent       strains. The pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes reflects its ability to resist       gastric and bile acids, colonize the intestinal lumen, cross the intestinal       barrier, survive intracellularly in the bloodstream, evade immune responses, and       cross the placental and blood-brain barriers. Diagnosis of listeriosis       (septicaemia, neurolisteriosis, maternal-neonatal listeriosis or focal       listeriosis) involves clinical observations and microbiological testing based on       bacterial culture or DNA detection in individuals with prior antimicrobial       therapy. Treatment typically involves aminopenicillins and aminoglycosides, with       no evidence of clinically meaningful acquired antimicrobial resistance. Although       listeriosis is a well-studied infection, a clearer picture of its global burden,       its pathophysiology, the dynamics of the L. monocytogenes population and       transmission routes is needed. On the host side, new risk factors, including       genetics, and new treatment regimens to improve patient outcomes need to be       identified.	Nature reviews. Disease primers	02/10/2025
10.1016/j.molmed.2025.09.002	Endometriosis and comorbidities: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.	Petraglia F, Vannuccini S, Donati C, Jeljeli M, Bourdon M, Chapron C	Endometriosis, traditionally viewed as a gynecological condition, is increasingly       recognized as a systemic disease due to its frequent association with       inflammatory and autoimmune comorbidities. Recent molecular and genetic insights       reveal dysregulated hormone receptor signaling, heightened inflammatory       responses, and immune dysfunction as central drivers of disease progression.       These discoveries offer compelling explanations for extra-pelvic symptoms and       open up avenues for targeted diagnostics and therapies. This review integrates       emerging evidence to highlight endometriosis as a multisystem disorder,       underscoring the need for multidisciplinary care. By redefining endometriosis       beyond reproductive health, this perspective encourages a broader, systemic view       of women's health and fosters innovation in precision medicine.

10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.012	Inflammation in atherosclerosis: Lessons and therapeutic implications.	Libby P, Soehnlein O	Inflammatory pathways operate at all stages of atherosclerosis. These processes       are driven by risk factors and other stimuli that can spark inflammation by       eliciting misdirected responses of intrinsic vascular cells and leukocytes,       culminating in lesion initiation, progression, and complication. Continuing       dissection of the key underlying inflammatory mechanisms with increasingly       sophisticated tools has inspired successful clinical trials and enabled       translation to the clinic. Here, we review the mechanistic understanding of the       etiology and progression of atherosclerosis. We discuss how cardiovascular risk       factors converge at the level of the bone marrow to perturb hematopoiesis,       yielding output with a pro-inflammatory slant. We further consider how       circulating myeloid cells enter, propagate, and persist in atherosclerotic       lesions and how intimal macrophages take center stage in regulating the       inflammatory milieu. In this context, we delineate emerging therapeutic       strategies aimed at mitigating inflammation in atherosclerosis and how these add       to existing measures toward reducing the global cardiovascular disease burden.

10.1038/s41380-025-03273-w	Classification of major depressive disorder using vertex-wise brain sulcal depth,       curvature, and thickness with a deep and a shallow learning model.	Goya-Maldonado R, Erwin-Grabner T, Zeng LL, Ching CRK, Aleman A, Amod AR, Basgoze Z, Benedetti F, Besteher B, Brosch K, Bülow R, Colle R, Connolly CG, Corruble E, Couvy-Duchesne B, Cullen K, Dannlowski U, Davey CG, Dols A, Ernsting J, Evans JW, Fisch L, Fuentes-Claramonte P, Gonul AS, Gotlib IH, Grabe HJ, Groenewold NA, Grotegerd D, Hahn T, Hamilton JP, Han LKM, Harrison BJ, Ho TC, Jahanshad N, Jamieson AJ, Karuk A, Kircher T, Klimes-Dougan B, Koopowitz SM, Lancaster T, Leenings R, Li M, Linden DEJ, MacMaster FP, Mehler DMA, Meinert S, Melloni E, Mueller BA, Mwangi B, Nenadić I, Ojha A, Okamoto Y, Oudega ML, Penninx BWJH, Poletti S, Pomarol-Clotet E, Portella MJ, Radua J, Rodríguez-Cano E, Sacchet MD, Salvador R, Schrantee A, Sim K, Soares JC, Solanes A, Stein DJ, Stein F, Stolicyn A, Thomopoulos SI, Toenders YJ, Uyar-Demir A, Vieta E, Vives-Gilabert Y, Völzke H, Walter M, Whalley HC, Whittle S, Winter N, Wittfeld K, Wright MJ, Wu MJ, Yang TT, Zarate C, Veltman DJ, Schmaal L, Thompson PM	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects       the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even today,       researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD,       likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep       learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear       patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for       MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls       (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches       have reported low accuracies. In this study, we used globally representative data       from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7012 participants from 31 sites       (N = 2772 MDD and N = 4240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with       generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise       cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the       classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the       expectation that the former would outperform the latter. As we analyzed a       multi-site sample, we additionally applied the ComBat harmonization tool to       remove potential nuisance effects of site. We found that both classifiers       exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance       (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; 55%) was found when the cross-validation       folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion,       the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the       non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC.       Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of       features and classifiers is unfeasible. Future studies are needed to determine       whether more sophisticated integration of information from other MRI modalities       such as fMRI and DWI will lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.

10.1016/j.tibs.2025.09.001	Mitochondrial dynamics and pore formation in regulated cell death pathways.	Hohorst L, Ros U, Garcia-Saez AJ	Mitochondria act as central hubs for cell death signaling. During apoptosis and       regulated necrosis (pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis), mitochondria       undergo drastic changes including membrane permeabilization, fragmentation, and       loss of membrane potential. However, dissection of the mechanisms underlying       these processes is challenging because they involve remodeling of mitochondrial       membranes coupled to the assembly of protein complexes whose dynamics are       difficult to capture. We discuss progress in our understanding of mitochondrial       alterations in cell death and highlight state-of-the-art experimental approaches       to study them. We focus on advanced single-molecule and correlative microscopy       methods which have recently provided unprecedented details about the dynamics and       structure of protein complexes in mitochondria and their impact on membrane       organization.

10.1136/openhrt-2025-003636	Postmarketing analysis of sotatercept: identifying serious unlabelled events.	Cao Z, Xiao Q, Li X, Zhang H, Zhang M	Sotatercept, an activin signalling inhibitor approved in March 2024 for       pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials.       This pharmacovigilance study evaluated its real-world safety profile using the US       Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to       identify postmarketing risks. FAERS reports from 2024 were analysed,       focusing on cases where sotatercept was designated as the primary suspect.       Duplicate entries were removed using standardised FDA protocols. Adverse events       (AEs) were categorised using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities       (MedDRA V.28.0). Disproportionality signals were assessed via reporting ORs       (RORs; 95% CI lower limit >1 with ≥3 cases). Severity was classified using the       EudraVigilance Important Medical Events (IMEs) list. Among 1 484 350       deduplicated reports, 613 sotatercept-associated AEs (1717 occurrences, 395       MedDRA terms) were identified. Disproportionality analysis revealed 48 safety       signals: 30 aligned with labelled risks (eg, haemoglobin elevation (ROR=272.2),       telangiectasia (ROR=334.1)) and 18 novel signals. The most frequent AEs included       headache (n=78), epistaxis (n=57) and diarrhoea (n=53). Two unlabelled       events-cerebral haemorrhage and ascites-met criteria for critical IMEs. Most       reports originated from the USA (98.5%) and involved females (73.6%). This study confirms sotatercept's labelled risks (haematological and vascular       effects) and identifies novel safety concerns, including cerebral haemorrhage and       ascites, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring in PAH management.       Real-world data underscore the value of postmarketing surveillance for detecting       rare or unanticipated AEs. Clinicians should prioritise monitoring for       haematological abnormalities and bleeding risks. Longitudinal studies are       warranted to clarify long-term safety outcomes.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.34491	Electroacupuncture in Patients With Early Urinary Incontinence After Radical       Prostatectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Niu J, Wang Y, Wang Y, Shi J, Liang J, Zhao X, Xu T, Guo H, Qiu X	Postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (UI) impairs quality of life,       yet effective noninvasive therapies remain limited. To investigate the       efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in patients with early UI after radical       prostatectomy (RP). DESIGN, SETTING, This prospective,       single-center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was conducted at Nanjing       Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University,       from July 23, 2021, to November 1, 2024, with 20-week follow-up completed March       24, 2025. Men with localized prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted RP and       experienced UI (defined as use of ≥2 pads per day) 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively       were consecutively enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 to the electroacupuncture       or sham stimulation group. Patients with any prior neoadjuvant hormonal therapy,       any prior prostatic surgery, any history of pelvic surgery, and history of UI       before RP were excluded. Three participants withdrew before the intervention, and       101 (91.8%) completed follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.       Patients in the electroacupuncture group received       electroacupuncture administered at bilateral Ciliao, Zhongliao, and Xialiao       acupoints, with sparse-dense wave electrostimulation (alternating between 2 and       15 Hz) for 30 minutes per session, 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The sham       stimulation group underwent identical procedures with nonpuncturing flat-tip       needles at offset points. The primary outcome was       urinary continence (UC), defined as the use of 0 to 1 pad per day 6 weeks after       the first electroacupuncture session. A total of 110 men (median age, 69       [IQR, 67-72] years) were randomized. At week 6, the intention-to-treat analysis       showed that the electroacupuncture group achieved a significantly higher UC rate       than the sham stimulation group (24 of 55 [43.6%] vs 12 of 55 [21.8%]; relative       risk, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.12-3.59; P = .02). The findings       of this randomized clinical trial show that electroacupuncture significantly       accelerated postprostatectomy UC recovery and may serve as a safe adjunct to       standard care. These findings support integrating electroacupuncture into       multimodal rehabilitation protocols to reduce early UI burden. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04972669.

10.1038/s41467-025-63707-5	Contribution of leukocyte telomere length to cardiovascular disease onset from       genome-wide cross-trait analysis.	Qiao J, Wang Q, Zhao Y, Chang M, Sun S, Zhang P, Yao K, Chen M, Zheng L, Xing X, Cai L, Jegga AG, Jiang L, Pauklin S, Zou R, Yang Y, Feng Y	Telomere shortening is a well-established marker of cellular aging and genomic       instability. While the relationship between leukocyte telomere length and       cardiovascular diseases has long been of interest, their genetic interplay       remains incompletely understood. In this study, we observe substantial genetic       overlap beyond genome-wide correlations and identify a potential causal       relationship between leukocyte telomere length and coronary artery disease.       Specifically, we discover 248 pleiotropic loci, 22 of which show strong evidence       of colocalization. Some shared loci implicate multiple pleiotropic genes across       different trait pairs, including ALDH2, ACAD10, TMEM116, SH2B3 (all at 12q24.12),       TMED6 (16q22.1), SERPINF1 (17p13.3), and XPO7 (8p21.3). Functional analysis       highlights key pathways involved in DNA biosynthesis and telomere maintenance.       Notably, SH2B3 is validated through proteome-wide Mendelian randomization       analysis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Here we report the       shared genetic basis between leukocyte telomere length and cardiovascular       diseases, providing valuable insights into future therapeutic developments.

10.1016/j.rmcr.2025.102286	"A novel cystic fibrosis mutation ""delS1255"" in a male diagnosed at birth."	Gerges M, Sutherland S, Chiasson M	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic       variants in the CFTR gene. Over 2000 CFTR variants have been identified, and       ongoing genetic characterization remains critical for guiding eligibility for       CFTR modulator therapies and contributing to variant databases that support       diagnosis and research. We describe a 20-year-old Caucasian male who is a       compound heterozygous for the common F508del mutation and a novel variant,       p.Ser1255del (c.3763_3765delTCA; delS1255). He was diagnosed with CF in the       neonatal period following meconium ileus, confirmed by elevated sweat chloride       testing. His clinical course included pancreatic insufficiency, chronic       Staphylococcus aureus colonization, and sinus disease with nasal polyps, but no       evidence of CF-related diabetes or liver disease. Molecular diagnostic testing       conducted at Stanford Clinical Laboratory using PCR and bidirectional Sanger       sequencing confirmed the F508del mutation and identified the previously       unreported delS1255 variant, an in-frame deletion of a serine residue at position       1255. This variant is absent from population databases and a missense mutation at       the same codon has previously been associated with severe CF phenotypes,       supporting its likely pathogenicity. The patient was initiated on       elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) therapy in 2021, based on the presence of       the F508del allele. Since starting ETI, he has experienced substantial clinical       improvement, including improved spirometry, radiology, and a marked reduction in       sweat chloride concentration. The response is presumed to be driven by the       F508del variant, while the effect of delS1255 on modulator responsiveness remains       unknown.

10.1002/adma.202508072	Engineered Apoptotic Extracellular Vesicles for Programmable Regulation of       Neutrophil-Macrophage-ROS Pathogenic Axis to Reconstruct Rheumatoid Arthritis       Microenvironment.	Kang Y, Han X, Zhou S, Wang X, Wang Y, Song P, Su X, Qin M, Qian D, Meng H, Yan J, Pu F, Zhang H	Rheumatoid arthritis microenvironment (RAM) contains complex pathogenic mediators       that interact dynamically to drive the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).       However, most current RA treatments are single-target interventions, exerting       limited impact on RAM. Herein, apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEV) are       constructed for programmable regulation of the neutrophil-macrophage-ROS       pathogenic axis, aiming to reconstruct RAM and improve RA therapy. Mesenchymal       stem cells (MSCs) are pretreated with dexamethasone (Dex) and induced apoptosis       to produce Dex-loaded and FasL-overexpressing ApoEV (D@ApoEV(FasL)), which is       further modified with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) through a       ROS-responsive cleavage linker to form D@ApoEV(FasL)∩L. After intravenous       injection into RA mice, D@ApoEV(FasL)∩L targeted the inflamed joints based on       their MSC-derived feature and blocked neutrophil recruitment through binding to       P-selectin on vascular endothelial cells. In response to high ROS,       D@ApoEV(FasL)∩L shed LMWH and exposed FasL, inducing neutrophil apoptosis through       the Fas/FasL signaling pathway. Subsequently, the apoptotic neutrophils triggered       macrophage reprogramming from M1 to M2 phenotype, and the released Dex       significantly reduced the oxidative damage. Various in vitro and in vivo       assessments have confirmed that D@ApoEV(FasL)∩L can effectively regulate       neutrophils, macrophages, and ROS, trigger an immune cascade, and restore       intra-articular immune homeostasis, exhibiting an effective RAM reconstruction       ability and a promising therapeutic effect for RA.

10.1186/s41043-025-01090-z	Effects of ketogenic diet on muscle mass, strength, aerobic metabolic capacity,       and endurance in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Wang Y, Xiao Q, Zhang Z, Yang Y	The ketogenic diet (KD) has gained popularity as an efficient       approach to weight loss and body fat loss. Concerns about reducing muscle mass       and performance have been rising during weight loss, as muscle mass and       functionality are crucial for health. However, the effects of the KD on muscles       not only for athletes or trainers but also for adults with less physical exercise       are still controversial. We conducted a thorough search of databases       including Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to July 19,       2025. Three aspects of muscle assessment were conducted, including muscle mass,       power and strength, aerobic metabolic capacity, and endurance. We included       randomized and non-randomized controlled studies that compared the KD with other       dietary interventions. Studies without control groups were excluded. A       random-effects model would be utilized when significant differences in       populations and interventions across studies were of concern. The GRADE system       was employed to assess evidence quality, while evidence reliability was gauged       via sensitivity analysis. A total of 33 studies were analyzed, revealing       no significant differences between the KD and other diets in muscle mass (0.06, 95%-1.97 to 2.09, p = 0.95), muscle power (countermovement jump: -0.06, 95%-0.49 to 0.38, p = 0.80) and strength (squat: -0.19, 95%-0.53 to 0.15, p = 0.27; bench press: -0.15, 95%-0.49 to 0.18,       p = 0.37). However, a significant decrease in fat-free mass (-0.48, 95%-0.73 to -0.23, p < 0.001) and fat mass (-1.31, 95%-2.06 to -0.57,       p < 0.001) was observed in the KD group compared with the control group. The KD       also improved fat oxidation (0.13, 95%0.08 to 0.17, p < 0.001) and       reduced respiratory exchange ratio (-0.07, 95%-0.11 to -0.03, p < 0.001)       during an exercise test. The VO(2max) and VO(2max) relative to body weight,       treadmill time to exhaustion, and rating of perceived exertion were not       significantly affected by KD. Among adult populations, KD can       increase fat oxidation to modify muscle metabolism, while no significant       reduction in muscle mass or strength was observed. Additional well-designed       randomized controlled trials are warranted to definitively determine the effects       of ketogenic diets on muscle parameters.

10.1186/s12964-025-02403-9	The primary cilium as a multifunctional organelle: emerging roles and unanswered       questions.	Corbeil D, Thamm K, Karbanová J, Fargeas CA, Jászai J	"The primary cilium, a solitary membrane-bound, microtubule-based cellular       organelle, has been considered an evolutionary relict for almost a century. Over       the past three decades, interest in this protruding, non-motile structure of the       plasma membrane has been boosted by the identification of ciliary dysfunctions as       the underlying cause of developmental abnormalities and inherited disorders,       commonly called ciliopathies. The primary cilium responds to environmental       stimuli, such as mechanical, chemical, or light (in the case of the modified       cilium of photoreceptors) signals. The membrane of primary cilia host specific       sensory complexes and/or receptors associated with various pathways, predisposing       them to transmit (or convert) spatiotemporal environmental information into       cellular response. These dual mechanochemical aspects led to the recognition that       primary cilia are multifunctional sensory organelles that act as ""cellular       antennae"". Beyond their established role in signal transduction, primary cilia       are newly recognized as important hubs for short- and long-distance intercellular       communication due to their ability to release and, perhaps, selectively take up       extracellular vesicles, which are biological carriers exchanged between cells. In       addition, the physical contact of the primary cilium with other cilia, cytonemes       or with nerve cell axons adds another layer of complexity to the mechanisms of       sensory and/or intercellular communication between neighboring cells that needs       to be further explored. In this review, we focus on these new and less-explored       ciliary properties and processes, which can affect cell communication and       signaling and thus have a direct impact on development, tissue homeostasis, and       pathological conditions."

10.1007/s00011-025-02105-5	Integrative genomics and functional immunology reveal Clostridia species as       modulators of neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Wang S, Jiang H, Yao T	This multiomics study investigated causal relationships between the       gut microbiota (GM), immune dysregulation, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis       (ALS) pathogenesis using Mendelian randomization (MR) with experimental       validation. Analyses incorporated genome-wide data from 87,347       participants (n = 7738; 20,806 patients, 59,804 controls; immune       phenotypes: n = 3757), transcriptomic data from 71 subjects (56 ALS patients, 15       controls), and experimental validation in matched cohorts (n = 6 subjects per       group). Two-sample bidirectional MR and mediation analysis were used to       evaluate associations. Experimental validation employed flow cytometry for       myeloid-derived suppressor cell quantification, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay       for cytokines, and real-time polymerase chain reaction for bacterial validation.       Statistical analyses included inverse variance weighted methods with Cohen's d       calculations. Sixteen bacterial taxa, including       p_Firmicutes.c_Clostridia, displayed protective associations with the risk of       ALS, whereas sixteen showed harmful associations. Mediation analysis suggested       that p_Firmicutes.c_Clostridia may confer protection through       CD33+HLA-DR-myeloid-derived suppressor cell upregulation (23.8% mediation       effect). Experimental validation confirmed fewer myeloid-derived suppressor cells       in ALS patients (4.0 ± 0.8% vs. 7.5 ± 1.0%, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.4) and lower       levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1: Cohen's d = 1.8, p < 0.001).       These findings support causal associations between gut microbial       taxa and the ALS risk, which are mediated through immunoregulatory mechanisms,       highlighting therapeutic targets within the gut‒immune‒brain axis.

10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102396	Updated efficacy and predictive biomarkers of QL1706, a bifunctional PD-1/CTLA-4       dual blocker in advanced solid tumors-A phase 1/1b study.	Ma Y, Lin S, Chen Q, Xue J, Yang Y, Zang A, Cheng Y, Zhang Y, Wang X, Chen Z, Qu S, He J, Chen C, Jin C, Zhu D, Li Q, Liu X, Su W, Ba Y, Li W, Li Q, Zhu C, Huang Z, Kang X, Xue S, Li H, Wang C, Luo F, Huang Y, Zhang L, Zhao H	QL1706 has shown promising efficacy in solid tumors in a phase 1/1b study. Here,       we report updated long-term survival outcomes and biomarker analyses. Among 468       patients treated with QL1706 (5 mg/kg), median progression-free survival (mPFS)       and overall survival (mOS) are 1.5 and 14.2 months for non-small cell lung cancer       (NSCLC), 1.9 and 20.2 months for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and 4.2 and 18.6       months for cervical cancer (CC), respectively. Liver metastasis is correlated       with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC and       poor OS in CC, while elevated lactate dehydrogenase is linked to shorter PFS and       OS in NPC. CDK4/11q13 diploid or the expression of GZMK(high) & MYC(low)       distinguishes NPCs with the most favorable PFS. In NSCLC, PD-L1(+)/TIL(+) or a       low CXCL13 ratio indicates better outcomes. QL1706 offers long-term survival       benefits in solid tumors, with identified molecular markers aiding in selecting       suitable candidates. This study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov       (NCT04296994 and NCT05171790).	Cell reports. Medicine	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.jhep.2025.08.038	Reversal of ACLF and ALF using whole blood extracorporeal system combining       HLA-depleted liver organoids with granulocyte-monocyte apheresis.	Yamaguchi H, Yoneyama Y, Ichimura K, Ohtsu K, Soen M, Moriya C, Kumagai M, Myers RP, Subramanian GM, Takebe T	BACKGROUND & Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by       catastrophic loss of liver function in patients with advanced chronic liver       disease, with 28-day mortality rates reaching up to 80%. Despite advances in       intensive care, the high mortality primarily stems from the absence of a       therapeutic modality that simultaneously addresses both the profound systemic       inflammatory response and severe hepatic synthetic dysfunction. We       designed an integrated extracorporeal circuit, termed the UTOpiA system, which       combines granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) with human induced pluripotent       stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cell (iHLC) organoids engineered with HLA-A,       HLA-B, and CIITA triple knockout. The efficacy of UTOpiA was tested after direct       whole blood exposure through venous flow in rat models of ACLF and acute liver       failure (ALF). UTOpiA treatment significantly improved survival in both       ACLF and ALF rat models, outperforming GMA or iHLC monotherapy and HepG2       cell-based devices. Improved survival was associated with reduced coma severity,       improved liver biochemistry, and reduced hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and       systemic inflammation. Transcriptomic and histological analyses revealed       restoration of hepatic metabolic gene expression and hepatocyte regeneration.       Mechanistically, iHLC-secreted α-fetoprotein suppressed hepatocyte cell cycle       arrest via p21 downregulation and enhanced regeneration, while UTOpiA restored       HNF4α activity and dampened pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α.       The tandem UTOpiA circuit confers a significant survival benefit in       preclinical rodent models of ACLF and ALF by providing anti-inflammatory,       synthetic, and metabolic support. Elucidating the regenerative signals that       promote recovery of the injured liver may further expand the potential of this       whole blood extracorporeal system as a novel, off-the-shelf liver support       therapy. Restoring hepatic metabolism while controlling       inflammation in acutely decompensated cirrhosis remains a major unmet clinical       need. By combining HLA-modified human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived liver       organoids with granulocyte and monocyte apheresis, we developed a bioartificial       liver system that manages inflammation, restores liver function, and promotes       regeneration in two rat models of severe liver failure. This therapy could offer       an off-the-shelf treatment option for patients with life-threatening liver       failure.	Journal of hepatology	02/10/2025
10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00299-1	Reframing remission in severe asthma: a conceptual framework for distinguishing       disease activity versus damage.	Porsbjerg C, Rupani H, Brannan JD, Ueki S, Nawijn MC, Erjefält JS, Chanez P, Anderson GP, Pavord ID	Remission is emerging as a feasible treatment goal in moderate-to-severe asthma,       driven by the success of biologic therapies in controlling inflammation and       reducing exacerbations. Yet current definitions of remission-focused on symptom       control, lung function, and corticosteroid reduction-lack precision, can only be       ascertained retrospectively, and do not reflect the underlying mechanisms and       pathology that drive disease progression. This gap limits the clinical       applicability of these definitions and might obscure opportunities for early,       disease-modifying intervention. In this Series paper, we propose a refined       framework for understanding and reaching remission, centred on distinguishing       modifiable disease activity from irreversible remodelling and comorbidity-related       factors that contribute to disease burden. We introduce the concept of at-risk       asthma as a crucial phase characterised by high disease activity and immune       dysregulation, in which timely intervention might prevent irreversible airway and       extrapulmonary damage and support long-term disease modification. We examine how       symptoms, lung function impairment, and exacerbations can arise from distinct and       overlapping mechanisms, underscoring the need for careful attribution in clinical       assessment. We also outline four key pathophysiological domains-airway       hyper-responsiveness, immune hyper-responsiveness, immune remodelling, and       structural remodelling-and describe their temporal evolution and implications for       treatment responsiveness. Finally, we present a domain-based strategy for       assessment and intervention, linking targeted therapies to underlying mechanisms.       This approach supports more personalised treatment decisions and redefines       remission, not simply as the absence of symptoms, but as stabilisation of disease       biology. As the field advances towards earlier intervention and more tailored       application of biologics in at-risk asthma, such a framework could be essential       to improve long-term outcomes and prevent overtreatment of irreversible disease.

Yet not all patients derive       treatment benefits, and reliable biomarkers of response are still lacking. We       here assess the long-term clinical outcome of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and       perioperative anti-PD-L1 inhibition in resectable stage IIIA NSCLC in the SAKK       16/14 trial and provide a comprehensive characterization of anti-tumor immune       responses for biomarker-based treatment personalization.

Computer-aided       spatial image analysis emphasizes the importance of CD8(+) T cell positioning in       tumors, and larger tertiary lymphoid structures in pre-treatment biopsies       correlate with improved EFS. Genomic techniques reveal the association of       intratumoral TCR diversity with response.

10.1038/s41397-025-00384-z	Serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) is under-expressed in mucinous       colorectal cancer, and may mediate resistance to oxaliplatin.	Duggan WP, Azimi M, Flanagan L, Sullivan GP, Reynolds IS, Fay J, Dussmann H, Ní Chonghaile T, Sheehan KM, Jirström K, Prehn JHM, Burke JP	5-15% of all colorectal cancers (CRCs) are mucinous. Mucinous CRCs are associated       with an inhibited response to standard adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies.       Serine-Arginine Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1) is an enzyme, which modulates the       activity of multiple splicing factors. SRPK1 under-expression is associated with       resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents in multiple tumor types. The       objectives of this study were to evaluate SRPK1 expression in mucinous CRC and to       explore the potential relationship between differential SRPK1 expression and       oxaliplatin resistance in mucinous CRC. Rectal cancer and CRC Tissue Microarrays       (TMA) were stained with SRPK1 to compare expression between mucinous and       non-mucinous tumors. SRPK1 expression was analyzed in mucinous and non-mucinous       CRC cell lines. Cells were treated with oxaliplatin to explore differences in       treatment response. Mucinous cells were transfected with an SRPK1 CRISPR/Cas9       lentiviral activation plasmid to investigate the relationship between SRPK1       expression and oxaliplatin resistance. The TMA cohorts included 117 patients with       mucinous and 441 patients with non-mucinous CRC. SRPK1 was found to be       under-expressed in both the mucinous rectal cancer (P < 0.001) and CRC cohorts       (P = 0.003). On univariate analysis, SRPK1 under-expression was found to be       associated with worse 5-year OS (P = 0.001). Treatment of mucinous CRC cells with       oxaliplatin did not result in a significant increase in cell death (P = 0.149).       However overexpression of SRPK1 following transfection with a CRISPR/CAS9       activation plasmid resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity of these       cells to oxaliplatin treatment (P = 0.029). SRPK1 is under-expressed in mucinous       CRC, and under-expression is associated with worse OS. This may be due to the       positive effects of SRPK1 on oxaliplatin sensitivity.

10.1038/s41586-025-09532-8	A new paradigm for outer membrane protein biogenesis in the Bacteroidota.	Liu X, Orenday Tapia L, Deme JC, Lea SM, Berks BC	In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is the first line of defence       against antimicrobial agents and immunological attacks(1). A key part of outer       membrane biogenesis is the insertion of outer membrane proteins by the       β-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM)(2-4). Here we report the cryo-electron       microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a       member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major       anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical       Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the       substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel       BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are       required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting       that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum.       For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its       essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and       enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in       the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1016/j.phrs.2025.107977	TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease: Pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies.	Zhou X, Lin X, He Y, Huang N, Luo Y	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by       the dysregulation of multiple molecular mechanisms. In recent years, transactive       response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) has increasingly been recognized as       a critical pathological protein and has become a prominent focus in AD research.       TDP-43 is involved not only in physiological processes such as RNA metabolism,       protein quality control, and mitochondrial regulation but also in AD pathology       through abnormal aggregation, dysregulated nucleocytoplasmic transport, and       aberrant posttranslational modifications, leading to neurotoxicity, mitochondrial       dysfunction, and disrupted protein homeostasis. Studies have shown that TDP-43       closely interacts with two core pathological hallmarks of AD, β-amyloid (Aβ) and       tau. By promoting Aβ oligomerization and tau hyperphosphorylation, TDP-43       accelerates the pathological progression of this disease. Given the multifaceted       role of TDP-43 in AD, therapeutic strategies targeting TDP-43 have shown great       potential. Approaches such as modulating its RNA splicing activity, inhibiting       pathological aggregation, restoring the balance of nucleocytoplasmic transport,       and preventing its mitochondrial localization offer new avenues for AD treatment.       This review systematically summarizes the pathological mechanisms of TDP-43 in AD       and its interactions with Aβ and tau and discusses the feasibility of targeting       TDP-43 as a therapeutic strategy. Future studies should further elucidate the       role of TDP-43 in the early stages of AD and develop specific therapeutic agents       that target TDP-43, with the aim of providing new insights for precision       treatment of AD.

10.1186/s13098-025-01947-7	C-reactive protein-triglyceride glucose index predicts mortality in       cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stage 0-3: a prospective cohort study.	Ying Q, He F, Wu L, Wei Q, Xu J	Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is defined by the       interplay of metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular       disease. The C-reactive protein-triglyceride glucose index (CTI) is a composite       biomarker that reflects both inflammation and insulin resistance, but whether it       is associated with mortality in persons with early-stage CKM syndrome is unknown.       We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination       Survey from 1999 to 2010. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models       to assess the association between the CTI score and the risk of all-cause       mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, with vital status       ascertained through Linkage to the National Death Index through December 31,       2019. Among 10,718 participants, a total of 1783 deaths (491 from CVD)       occurred during a mean follow-up of 14.0 years. In fully adjusted models, a       higher CTI score was associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR       per unit increase, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.36 to 1.78) and of CVD mortality (HR per unit       increase, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.49 to 2.77). The association with all-cause mortality       was stronger among participants under the age of 60 than among those over 60       years old (P < 0.001 for interaction). Our study found that in       patients with early-stage CKM syndrome, a higher CTI was independently associated       with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. This association       was more significant in younger participants.	Diabetology & metabolic syndrome	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.056	The significance of urine extracellular vesicle DNA methylation detection in the       diagnosis and classification of prostate cancer.	Ding T, Diao Y, Fu R, Gong C, He Q, He W, Zhang L, Yang X, Zeng X, Yu L, Liu J, Shi W, Zhang K, Hao X	As one of the most common malignant tumors in men, prostate cancer       (PCa) still lacks convenient, non-invasive and highly specific diagnostic       markers. The advantages of Extracellular vesicle (EV) DNA in tumor diagnosis have       gradually attracted the attention of researchers. However, methylation detection,       which is more advantageous than mutation detection in tumor diagnosis, has not       been widely practiced in EV DNA, and its value in PCa diagnosis also remains       underexplored. This study aims to establish and optimize an EV DNA       methylation detection system and evaluate its diagnostic and classification       potential for PCa. We characterized EV DNA biological properties,       optimized pretreatment strategies, validated its correlation with genomic DNA       methylation, and explored urine EV DNA methylation targets in 86 benign prostatic       hyperplasia (BPH) and 109 PCa patients across three cohorts (screening: 30 BPH/33       PCa; training: 27 BPH/30 PCa; validation: 29 BPH/46 PCa). Heterogeneous       biological characteristics were observed among DNA from different subtypes of EV,       but methylation profiles remained consistent across subtypes and post-DNase I       treatment. EV DNA accurately reflected the methylation state of source cell       genomic DNA. By combining our screening results with data from the TCGA database       and previously reported, we developed a panel consisting of 667 PCa-specific       methylation targets for detection. Among these, six methylation sites       (MACF1、LINC01359-1、LINC01359-2、ADCY4、GAPLINC、C19orf25) demonstrated high       diagnostic value for PCa, enabling construction of PCa and aggressive PCa       differential diagnosis model with AUCs up to 0.74 and 0.91 respectively. The       diagnostic value of these six markers was further confirmed using methylight PCR       in the validation cohort which also displayed promising performance as a tool for       diagnosing PCa. This study highlights the potential of urine EV DNA       methylation as a novel diagnostic marker for PCa and lays a foundation for future       EV DNA research.

10.1186/s10195-025-00885-4	Active and passive physical therapy in patients with chronic low-back pain: a       level I Bayesian network meta-analysis.	Baroncini A, Maffulli N, Manocchio N, Bossa M, Foti C, Schäfer L, Klimuch A, Migliorini F	Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is common. Physiotherapy is frequently       indicated as a non-pharmacological management of these patients. This Bayesian       network meta-analysis compared active versus passive physiotherapy versus their       combination in terms of pain and disability in patients with mechanical and/or       aspecific cLBP. In June 2025, the following databases were accessed:       PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Embase. All the randomised controlled       trials (RCTs) which evaluated the efficacy of a physiotherapy program in patients       with LBP were accessed. Data regarding pain scores, the Roland-Morris Disability       Questionnaire (RMQ) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were collected. The       network meta-analyses were performed using the STATA (version 14; StataCorp,       College Station, TX, USA) routine for Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model       analysis, employing the inverse variance method. The standardised mean difference       (STD) was used for continuous data. Data from 2768 patients (mean age       46.9 ± 10.9 years, mean BMI 25.8 ± 2.9 kg/m(2)) were collected. The mean length       of follow-up was 6.2 ± 6.1 months. Between groups, comparability was found at       baseline in terms of mean age, proportion of women, mean BMI, symptom duration       and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). By the end of the follow-up       period, the active group evidenced the lowest pain scores (SMD 1.00; 95% CI -3.28       to 5.28). The active group evidenced the lowest RMQ score (SMD 0.94; 95% CI -4.96       to 3.09). The active group evidenced the lowest ODI score (SMD -1.23; 95% CI       -9.83 to 7.36). Active physiotherapy showed better results than       passive physiotherapy and a combination of both for the management of mechanical       and/or non-specific cLBP.

10.1371/journal.pone.0127045	Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood: Retrospective Genetic Study and       Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in 187 Subjects from the US AHCF Registry.

Published studies to date indicate 2       recurrent mutations, D801N and E815K, and a more severe phenotype in the E815K       cohort. We performed mutation analysis and retrospective genotype-phenotype       correlations in all eligible patients with AHC enrolled in the US AHC Foundation       registry from 1997-2012. Clinical data were abstracted from standardized       caregivers' questionnaires and medical records and confirmed by expert       clinicians. We identified ATP1A3 mutations by Sanger and whole genome sequencing,       and compared phenotypes within and between 4 groups of subjects, those with       D801N, E815K, other ATP1A3 or no ATP1A3 mutations. We identified heterozygous       ATP1A3 mutations in 154 of 187 (82%) AHC patients. Of 34 unique mutations, 31       (91%) are missense, and 16 (47%) had not been previously reported. Concordant       with prior studies, more than 2/3 of all mutations are clusteredin exons 17 and       18. Of 143 simplex occurrences, 58 had D801N (40%), 38 had E815K(26%) and 11 had       G947R (8%) mutations [corrected].Patients with an E815K mutation demonstrate an       earlier age of onset, more severe motor impairment and a higher prevalence of       status epilepticus. This study further expands the number and spectrum of ATP1A3       mutations associated with AHC and confirms a more deleterious effect of the E815K       mutation on selected neurologic outcomes. However, the complexity of the disorder       and the extensive phenotypic variability among subgroups merits caution and       emphasizes the need for further studies.	PloS one	01/01/2015
10.1186/s13054-025-05573-7	The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic       review of randomised trials as a guide for future research.	McDonald R, Burns M, Wong A, Smith C, Ostermann M, Hutchings S	Patients with septic shock are high risk for developing acute kidney       injury (AKI), with its associated morbidity. This systematic review assessed the       evidence for an effect on renal outcomes from choice of vasopressor. Searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, congress abstracts       and trial registries. The search strategy included septic shock, vasopressor       agents and renal impairment. Inclusion criteria were non-crossover randomised       controlled trials of adult septic shock comparing individual or combinations of       vasopressors and placebo controlled trials. Primary outcome was the incidence of       AKI in study participants. Secondary outcomes were AKI duration, renal       replacement therapy (RRT) rate, RRT duration, renal failure free days,       requirement for long term RRT and Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) at 30 and       90 days. A total of 4259 patients, from 17 studies, were included.       Vasopressin and terlipressin studies predominated. In 8 studies reporting AKI       rate, no effect was seen relating to vasopressor choice. RRT rate was the most       reported secondary outcome. Of five studies that investigated the role of       vasopressin, only one showed significant benefit. Alongside limited reporting, no       conclusive benefit was demonstrated in other secondary outcomes. No studies       reported requirement for long term RRT, MAKE 30 or 90. This is the       first systematic review focussed on renal outcomes with differential vasopressor       therapy in septic shock. It illustrates the paucity of evidence supporting a       particular vasopressor. Also highlighted are problems of population and study       heterogeneity, as well as the focus on RRT as a proxy for renal outcomes.       Standardised renal outcome reporting, large and appropriately powered trials and       focussed sub-population studies are required to further inform renal focussed       vasopressor research and practice. This systematic review was       prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023481778).	Critical care (London, England)	02/10/2025
10.1002/ajh.70099	Clinical Characteristics, Treatment Responses and Outcomes of Light Chain       Multiple Myeloma.	Bolarinwa A, Zanwar S, Abdallah N, Buadi FK, Hayman SR, Gertz MA, Dispenzieri A, Muchtar E, Kapoor P, Gonsalves W, Kourelis T, Dingli D, Warsame R, Leung N, Cook J, Binder M, Lin Y, Hwa Y, Rogers MG, Hobbs M, Fonder A, Jevremovic D, Rajkumar SV, Kumar SK	Light chain multiple myeloma (LCMM) is a subtype of multiple myeloma (MM)       characterized by the exclusive production of immunoglobulin light chains and       accounts for 15%-20% of newly diagnosed MM. A comprehensive comparison of LCMM       with MM producing intact immunoglobulin (non-LCMM) remains limited. In this       retrospective study, we described distinct clinical and cytogenetic features and       assessed long-term outcomes in 852 LCMM patients diagnosed between 01/01/2004 and       12/31/2022, compared with non-LCMM controls matched for age, sex, and year of       diagnosis. On univariable analysis, LCMM patients were more likely to present       with elevated creatinine (> 2 mg/dL), beta-2-microglobulin ≥ 5.5 mg/L, elevated       LDH, hypercalcemia, t(11;14), del(13q), and t(6;14). Conversely, IMS-IMWG       high-risk disease, hyperdiploidy, t(4;14), and serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL were less       common. On multivariable analysis, elevated creatinine (5.1, 95% 1.2-27,       p = 0.04), t(11;14) (2.6, 95% 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006), and del(13q) (4.1,       95% 2.1-8.2, p < 0.001) were independently associated with LCMM, while       IMS-IMWG high-risk disease (0.3, 95% 0.1-0.8, p = 0.02) and hyperdiploidy       (0.3, 95% 0.1-0.7, p = 0.002) were less frequent. Despite these       differences, progression-free survival with frontline treatment (0.97, 95%       0.84-1.11, p = 0.63) and overall survival (0.99, 95% 0.87-1.13,       p = 0.94) were similar between LCMM and non-LCMM patients. This study highlights       the distinct clinical and cytogenetic features of LCMM, marked by higher rates of       renal failure, t(11;14), and del(13q), lower prevalence of IMS-IMWG high-risk       disease, and comparable survival outcomes.

10.1016/j.bbadis.2025.168065	Metabolic reprogramming represents a targetable mechanism to overcome acquired       resistance to venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia.	de Queiroz GN, Lima K, Cipelli M, Tomaz V, Cortez LGF, de Franca Basto Silva M, Guedes RLM, Campregher PV, Rego EM, Câmara NOS, Costa-Lotufo LV, Machado-Neto JA	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often develops resistance to the BCL2 inhibitor       venetoclax through metabolic reprogramming. This study established acquired       venetoclax-resistant AML models (MV4-11VR and MOLM-13VR) to explore resistance       mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Cell viability and apoptosis assays       revealed robust acquired resistance to venetoclax upon intermittent drug       exposure. Metabolic profiling revealed distinct adaptations: MV4-11VR cells       favored glycolysis, while MOLM-13VR cells increased oxidative phosphorylation.       Proteomic analysis supported these findings, showing pathway enrichment for       carbohydrate metabolism in MV4-11VR and aerobic energy production in MOLM-13VR.       Despite these differences, both models shared hyperactivation of the       PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, as shown by RPS6 hyperphosphorylation. Apoptotic       regulation also diverged between the cellular models in relation to modulated       BCL2-related genes and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Targeting these       metabolic changes with metformin (a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor) or       KPT-9274 (a NAMPT inhibitor) re-sensitized resistant cells to venetoclax.       Combination treatments showed strong synergy and near-complete cell elimination.       These results highlight metabolic reprogramming as a heterogeneous but targetable       resistance mechanism and support combining metabolic inhibitors with BCL2       blockade to treat refractory AML.

Machine learning       (ML) techniques have emerged as promising tools for classifying migraine patients       and uncovering the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that differentiate       migraine types and subtypes. This systematic review identifies current ML       classification models for migraine types and subtypes, evaluating the quality,       reproducibility, and clinical utility of published studies. The findings       demonstrate that current ML models, particularly support vector machines and       linear discriminant analysis, can accurately classify migraine patients based on       structural and functional neuroimaging features with accuracies ranging from 75       to 98%. However, quality assessment revealed significant methodological       heterogeneity across studies, including inconsistent reporting of model       performance, insufficient patient phenotyping, small and imbalanced datasets, and       limited external validation. These limitations hinder the global generalizability       and reproducibility of these studies. We propose a roadmap for future research       emphasizing well-characterized clinical subgrouping, standardized data       acquisition and feature engineering protocols, transparency in model development       and reporting, and collaborative multicentric designs to enable large-scale       validation. Furthermore, this review stresses the importance of incorporating       real-world phenotypic data, such as treatment response, comorbidities, and       digital phenotyping metrics, to enrich ML models and support the transition       toward precision medicine in migraine care. Ultimately, this review highlights       the urgent need for methodological rigor in migraine ML classification studies to       bridge the gap between experimental success and clinical applicability.

10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105808	Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors beyond progression in hormone       receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer: a systematic review and       meta-analysis (REIGNITE study).	de Almeida LFC, Leite LF, Filho VOC, Noronha MM, Cappellaro AP, Gouveia M, da Silva JL, Ernst B, de Melo AC, Tarantino P, Batalini F	Adding cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) to endocrine       therapy (ET) is considered the first-line treatment of advanced       HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. However, with the recent approval of       several additional targeted agents, the optimal treatment sequencing remains       uncertain, and it is unclear whether the benefits of CDK4/6i extend beyond       progression on first-line therapy. We conducted a       systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of CDK4/6i in the       second-line setting after progression on CDK4/6i in the first line, with a       particular focus on patients who had either PIK3CA or ESR1 mutation. We included       randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing CDK4/6i combined with ET to ET alone       in patients who experienced tumor progression on CDK4/6i treatment in the       first-line setting. The results were pooled using a random-effects model with 95%       confidence interval (CI). Five RCTs encompassing 1184 patients were       included. Overall, CDK4/6i plus ET significantly improved progression-free       survival (PFS) versus ET alone, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% CI       0.56-0.94, P < 0.05), with a more prominent benefit in patients who switched the       CDK4/6i (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.48-0.77, P < 0.05). The benefit was       consistent in patients with somatic PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% CI       0.52-0.98, P < 0.05), and ESR1 mutations (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.89, P       < 0.05). The toxicity profile was compatible with the known side effects from       CDK4/6i. Our results support the strategy of switching the CDK4/6i       in the second-line setting and demonstrate persistent benefit even in patients       with PIK3CA or ESR1 mutations.

Wang Z, Li Z, Högström J, Inuzuka H, Jing R, Yan P, Hou T, Qi Y, Huang D, Wang J, Wu T, Shi X, Liu B, Muranen T, Zhang D, Wei W	"Cancer drug resistance poses a significant challenge in oncology, often driven by       intricate cross-talk among membrane-bound receptors that compromise mono-targeted       therapies. We develop a dual membrane receptor degradation strategy leveraging       Folate Receptor α (FRα) to address this issue. Folate Receptor α Targeting       Chimeras-dual (FolTAC-dual) are engineered degraders designed to selectively and       simultaneously degrade distinct receptor pairs: (1) EGFR/HER2 and (2)       PD-L1/VISTA. Through modular optimization of modality configurations and       geometries, we identify the ""string"" format as the most effective construct.       Mechanistic studies demonstrate an ~85% increase in EGFR-binding affinity       compared to the conventional knob-into-hole design, likely contributing to the       improved efficiency of dual-target degradation. Proof-of-concept studies reveal       that EGFR and HER2 FolTAC-dual effectively counteracts resistance in       Trastuzumab/Lapatinib-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer models, while PD-L1       and VISTA FolTAC-dual rejuvenates immune responses in PD-L1 antibody-resistant       syngeneic mouse models. These findings establish FolTAC-dual as a promising       dual-degradation platform for clinical translation."	Nature communications	02/10/2025

However, achieving prediabetes remission, that is, reaching       normal glucose regulation according to American Diabetes Association criteria, is       more efficient in preventing T2D than solely reaching weight loss goals. Here we       present a post hoc analysis of the large, multicenter, randomized, controlled       Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS), demonstrating that prediabetes       remission is achievable without weight loss or even weight gain, and that it also       protects against incident T2D. The underlying mechanisms include improved insulin       sensitivity, β-cell function and increments in β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Weight       gain was similar in those achieving prediabetes remission (responders) compared       with nonresponders; however, adipose tissue was differentially redistributed in       responders and nonresponders when compared against each other-while nonresponders       increased visceral adipose tissue mass, responders increased adipose tissue in       subcutaneous depots. The findings were reproduced in the US Diabetes Prevention       Program. These data uncover essential pathways for prediabetes remission without       weight loss and emphasize the need to include glycemic targets in current       clinical practice guidelines to improve T2D prevention.

10.1186/s13148-025-01976-z	Exploring causal relationships between epigenetic age acceleration and       Alzheimer's disease: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.	Liu H, Yin Z, Chen X, Wang Z	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identified by a distinct progression of       aging-associated cognitive and functional impairment. Recent advances recognize       the DNA methylation-based epigenetic clock as a precise predictor of aging       processes and their related health outcomes. However, observational studies       exploring this link are often compromised by confounding factors and reverse       causality bias. To address the question, our study employs a bidirectional       Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between       epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and AD. Genome-wide association study       (GWAS) statistics for epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, PhenoAge, HorvathAge, and       HannumAge) were sourced from Edinburgh DataShare and the Alzheimer Disease       Genetics Consortium (ADGC). The dataset comprised 63,926 participants, and among       them, 21,982 cases were AD patients and 41,944 were controls. The primary       analytical method for the MR was the inverse variance weighted (IVW). The       potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity among the instrumental variables were       evaluated by additional sensitivity analyses. Employing the       random-effects IVW approach, we found that, as indicated by GrimAge, EAA was       associated with an increased risk of AD (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.025, 95% Confidence       Interval [CI]: 1.006-1.044, p = 0.009). Quality control assessments confirmed the       reliability and robustness of our findings. However, the evidence did not support       a causal relationship between AD and epigenetic aging in the reverse direction.       Our MR study indicates a positive causal relationship between EAA       and AD. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying physiological       mechanisms.

10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.01.008	Gardasil Vaccination for Recurrent Laryngeal Papillomatosis in Adult Men: First       Report: Changes in HPV Antibody Titer.	Makiyama K, Hirai R, Matsuzaki H	Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA-positive recurrent       laryngeal papillomatosis commonly have repeated recurrences following surgery.       The reason is suspected to be a mechanism by which latent HPV infection in the       surrounding healthy mucosa reinfects the surgical site. It may be that production       of HPV antibodies in the laryngeal mucosa with Gardasil injection could inhibit       postoperative recurrence. This is a case series study. The       purpose of this study was to examine whether Gardasil injection effectively       inhibits recurrence. However, as a first report, we describe the antibody titers       before and after vaccination. Gardasil was injected in 12 men (aged       32-74 years; mean age 47.9 years) with HPV-positive laryngeal papillomatosis.       Serum antibody titers of HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 were measured by a competitive       Luminex-based immunoassay before the vaccination and 7 months after the start of       the vaccination. Each of the antibody titers was very low before       vaccination, and they rose in all patients after the vaccination. This finding demonstrates that antibody titers increase with Gardasil injection       in post-adolescent males.	Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation	01/01/2016
10.4103/jisppd.jisppd_133_25	Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine, 25%       aqueous extract of propolis, and 2.4% curcuma longa as intracanal irrigants: An       ex vivo study.	Sengupta U, Sogi HPS, Shah SG, Bala R, Saini R, Garg N, Jain M	The primary teeth's unique histological properties and interactions with       the oral cavity pose a challenge in treatment, unlike the permanent teeth. A       repaired natural tooth maintains space better than an artificial one. These       factors lead to a greater emphasis on saving the tooth by pulpectomy involving       effective chemical cleaning and disinfection of canals than on meticulous       mechanical canal shaping. As chemically available irrigants show cytotoxic       effects, hence herbal-based irrigants are being considered viable options. The present study was undertaken to compare and assess the antimicrobial effect       of 2.4% Curcuma longa extract, 25% aqueous propolis, and 2% chlorhexidine in       deciduous teeth. Forty eight subjects in age range of 4-7       years were allocated equally into four groups - Group I: saline (Negative       control), Group 2% chlorhexidine (Positive control), Group 2.4% Curcuma       longa, and Group 25% aqueous propolis based on inclusion and exclusion       criteria. Isolation was achieved using a rubber dam. Pre and postirrigation       samples were collected using sterile absorbent paper points and transferred to a       test tube containing brain heart infusion. The pre and postirrigation samples       were sent for microbial assay. Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis       were isolated using standard microbiological methods, and serial dilution method       was done to determine the pre and post irrigation colony counts. The plates were       duplicated and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The preirrigation and post irrigation       colony count samples with different irrigants were counted and compared.       For the saline paired t-test was used to compare the pre-       and postirrigation values, and for 2% chlorhexidine, 2.4% curcuma longa, and 25%       aqueous extract of propolis groups. The Wilcoxon matched signed rank test was       used to compare pre- and post-irrigation bacterial counts. To compare the mean       change in bacterial colony counts ANOVA test was done. S. mutans and E.       faecalis were the most commonly isolated microorganisms. There was no statistical       significant difference between saline, 2% chlorhexidine, 2.4% curcuma longa, and       25% aqueous extract of propolis. The micro-organisms prevalent in       primary teeth with necrosis included S. mutans and E. faecalis.

10.1038/s41591-025-03956-5	A consensus immune dysregulation framework for sepsis and critical illnesses.	Moore AR, Zheng H, Ganesan A, Hasin-Brumshtein Y, Maddali MV, Levitt JE, van der Poll T, Lu J, Bouma HR, Scicluna BP, Giamarellos-Bourboulis EJ, Kotsaki A, Martin-Loeches I, Garduno A, Rothman RE, Sevransky J, Wright DW, Atreya MR, Moldawer LL, Efron PA, Kralovcova M, Karvunidis T, Giannini HM, Meyer NJ, Sweeney TE, Rogers AJ, Khatri P	Critical care syndromes such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome       (ARDS) and trauma continue to have unacceptably high morbidity and mortality,       with progress limited by the inherent heterogeneity within syndromic illnesses.       Although numerous immune endotypes have been proposed for sepsis and critical       care, the similarities and differences between these endotypes remain unclear,       hindering clinical translation. The SUBSPACE consortium is an international       consortium that aims to advance precision medicine in critical care through the       sharing of transcriptomic data. Here, evaluating the overlap of existing immune       endotypes in sepsis across >7,074 samples from 37 independent cohorts, we       developed cell-type-specific gene expression signatures to quantify dysregulation       within immune compartments. Myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation were associated       with disease severity and mortality across all cohorts. Importantly, this       dysregulation was also observed in patients with ARDS, trauma and burns,       suggesting a conserved mechanism across various critical illness syndromes.       Moreover, analysis of randomized controlled trial data revealed that myeloid and       lymphoid dysregulation are associated with differential mortality in patients       treated with anakinra in the SAVE-MORE trial (n = 452) and corticosteroids in the       VICTAS (n = 89) and VANISH (n = 117) trials, underscoring their prognostic and       therapeutic implications. In conclusion, our proposed immunology-based framework       for quantifying cellular compartment dysregulation offers a potentially valuable       tool for understanding immune dysregulation in critical illness with prognostic       and therapeutic significance.

10.1038/s41598-025-11466-0	Proteomic analysis of brain and spinal cord tissue reveals distinct immune and       mitochondrial processes between human and mouse ALS models.	Spiteri AG, Steele JR, Lee HC, Zhang H, Sun J, Schittenhelm RB, Yu CH, McLean C, Masters CL, Goudey B, Jin L, Pan Y	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease       resulting in the progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain and spine. More       than 95% of cases are pathologically characterized by the cytoplasmic       accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated transactive response       DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Multiple mouse models with TDP-43 accumulation       have been developed, however, whether they recapitulate molecular features of ALS       pathology is unclear. Given the lack of curative treatment for ALS, there is an       urgent need to identify the precise biological processes contributing to disease       pathogenesis for the development of effective therapeutic treatments. Thus, in       this study we employed label-based untargeted proteomics to characterize the ALS       proteome and related biological processes in the spinal cord and brain of       TDP-43(Q331K) mice, a transgenic mouse model of ALS and the motor cortex and the       cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord regions from humans. In humans, we       observed highly overlapping responses across the four tissues examined, primarily       related to the upregulation of immune processes and the downregulation of       mitochondrial function. In contrast, TDP-43(Q331K) mice demonstrate a lack of       enrichment for immune activation and the opposite regulation of mitochondrial       processes. A meta-analysis of previously published mouse datasets identified the       Ubqln2 knock-out mouse model as showing stronger parallels with our late-stage       human ALS. Overall, this study provides in-depth analysis of the site-specific       dysregulated proteomes and their associated functional processes across species.       Thereby, identifying potential therapeutic targets while emphasizing the       limitations of specific mouse models at certain timepoints in recapitulating       ALS-related processes for future model development.

10.3389/fphar.2025.1641747	Drug-induced agranulocytosis: a disproportionality analysis and umbrella review.	Lu Y, Wu B, Li K, Liu Z, Chen Y, Xu T	Drug-induced agranulocytosis (DIA) is a rare but life-threatening       hematologic disorder that demands increased clinical and research attention. This       study aimed to provide the current overview of DIA for clinical guidance.       Using real-world data from FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS),       we performed a disproportionality analysis to identify the drugs associated with       agranulocytosis, employing the information component and reporting odds ratio       algorithms. Logistic analysis was conducted to explore the confounding factors of       DIA. Time-to-onset analysis was implemented to compare the adverse event onset       time among different drugs. To comprehensively supplement and corroborate our       disproportionality findings, we further conducted an umbrella review of       systematic reviews (SRs). Five electronic databases were searched with SRs       addressing DIA as an included adverse event. Two independent reviewers performed       literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment according to the       preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement. The       results of the included SRs were synthesized using qualitative analysis. The disproportionality analysis revealed that most identified DIA signals were       for anticancer drugs. The top-five drugs with DIA signals by case number were       methotrexate (6,462 cases), lenalidomide (5,722 cases), rituximab (5,691 cases),       doxorubicin (4,391 cases), and carboplatin (4,371 cases). High-risk drugs (e.g.,       deferiprone), old age, and abnormal weight were strongly associated with DIA       based on multivariate logistic regression. Time-to-onset analysis showed that       clozapine has the longest median of onset time (1,121.3 days), while azithromycin       has the shortest time (8.1 days). The umbrella review included seven systematic       reviews, with five focusing on anticancer therapy. Their findings on       DIA-associated drugs, including protein kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint       inhibitors, were consistent with those from the disproportionality analysis.       Antibiotics, antithyroid drugs, and psychotropic drugs were also identified as       causative drugs of DIA. This study systematically reviewed the FAERS       database and existing literature on DIA to identify a spectrum of associated       drugs. Anticancer drugs were predominant, with targeted therapies comprising a       large proportion, while non-chemotherapy drugs were also identified as suspect       drugs. These findings underscored the need for heightened clinical vigilance       toward suspected drugs and highlighted the importance of future efforts to       validate high-risk mechanisms and explore DIA monitoring strategies.

10.1101/2025.08.14.670400	Symptomatic treatment by a BBB-permeable AAV engineered to restore TDP-43       function slows motor neuron disease and prevents paralysis.	Peethambaran Mallika A, Yu JG, Sitzman O, Baghel MS, Renganathan S, Sinha IR, Melnikova T, Ling JP, Wong PC	TAR DNA-binding protein 43kDa (TDP-43) dysfunction is an early pathogenic       mechanism that underlies amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating       neurodegenerative disorder that lacks disease modifying therapies. We previously       developed a mouse model in which TDP-43 is selectively deleted from motor neurons       ( ChAT-Cre;Tardbp (f/f) ) that mimics the early stages of ALS. Here, we       demonstrate that intravenous delivery of a blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeable       AAV capsid expressing our rationally designed splicing repressor CTR       (AAV-PHP.eB-CTR) in symptomatic ChAT-Cre;Tardbp (f/f) mice markedly slowed       disease progression and prevented paralysis. Systemic delivery of AAV-PHP.eB-CTR       led to transduction of ∼80% of spinal motor neurons, repression of       TDP-43-associated cryptic exons within motor neurons expressing CTR, and       attenuation of motor neuron loss. Notably, the addition of the TARDBP 3'UTR       autoregulatory element to CTR maintained its expression within a physiological       range. In control littermates that received AAV-PHP.eB-CTR and were monitored for       >20 months, grip strength and body weight remained normal, and no       histopathological abnormalities were observed, underscoring a favorable safety       profile for this gene therapy. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept       that BBB-crossing AAV delivery of CTR can rescue motor neuron disease through the       restoration of TDP-43 function, offering a promising mechanism-based therapeutic       strategy for ALS.	bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology	20/08/2025
10.1186/s12933-025-02928-w	Associations of six insulin resistance-related indices with the risk and       progression of cardio-renal-metabolic multimorbidity: evidence from the UK       biobank.	Liu L, Yu G, Ji X, Wang Y, He H	Insulin resistance (IR)-related indices are increasingly recognized       as important contributors to cardio-renal-metabolic (CRM) diseases. However, most       prior studies have focused on isolated outcomes or cross-sectional disease       status, lacking dynamic insight into disease progression. This study aimed to       evaluate the predictive value of six IR-related indices for CRM onset and       multistage progression using multistate modeling, and to explore potential       biological mechanisms through mediation analysis. We included 327,692       CRM-free participants from the UK Biobank in this prospective cohort study. Six       IR-related indices including triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass       index (TyG-BMI), TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC), TyG-waist-to-height ratio       (TyG-WHtR), triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio,       and metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), were calculated using       established formulas. Cox proportional hazards and multistate models were used to       assess associations with CRM incidence and progression. Predictive performance       was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement       (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Mediation analysis was       conducted for inflammatory, hepatic, and renal biomarkers. Over a mean       follow-up of 13.6 years, 17.3% (n = 58,563) of participants developed at least       one CRM disease. All six IR-related indices were significantly associated with       CRM multimorbidity, both in terms of incidence and progression. In predicting the       incidence of CRM diseases, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, and METS-IR demonstrated superior       performance. For each 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in TyG-WC, the risks of       developing first, double, and triple CRM diseases increased by 51.4%, 88.6%, and       128.7%, respectively (all P < 0.001), with similar gradients observed for       TyG-WHtR and METS-IR. Multistate Cox models further confirmed consistent       associations between IR-related indices and CRM progression, particularly for       TyG-WHtR and TyG. Specifically, a 1-SD increase in TyG-WHtR was associated with a       65.3% increased risk of transitioning from healthy to first CRM disease, 34.6%       from first to double, and 26.7% from double to triple CRM diseases (all       P < 0.001). In predictive performance evaluation, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, and METS-IR       achieved the highest AUC, NRI, and IDI values. Mediation analyses indicated that       systemic inflammation, organ function, and especially kidney function partially       mediated the observed associations. In summary, IR-related indices,       particularly TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, and METS-IR, were observed to be associated with       the presence and progression of CRM diseases. Their potential incorporation into       risk assessment and prevention strategies, together with consideration of       inflammatory and organ function pathways, might help reduce the burden of CRM       multimorbidity; however, further prospective studies are needed to confirm these       findings and clarify their clinical relevance.

10.1038/s41523-025-00814-y	Association of potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes in metastatic       triple-negative breast cancer treated with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.	Cortes J, Lipatov O, Im SA, Goncalves A, Lee KS, Schmid P, Tamura K, Testa L, Ohtani S, Harbeck N, Loi S, Salgado R, Karantza V, Mejia J, Cristescu R, Loboda A, Nebozhyn M, Jelinic P, Huang L, Winer EP	In the randomized, phase 3 KEYNOTE-119 study, overall survival (OS) was not       significantly improved with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W versus investigator's choice       of chemotherapy in participants with previously treated metastatic TNBC. In this       exploratory analysis, we evaluated associations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes       (TILs), T-cell‒inflamed gene expression profile (Tcell(inf)GEP), BRCA1/BRCA2       mutation (BRCAm) status, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status, and       tumor mutational burden (TMB) with clinical outcomes. TIL level was associated       with improved objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and       OS with pembrolizumab but not with chemotherapy or after adjusting for       Tcell(inf)GEP. Associations were also identified between Tcell(inf)GEP and       improved ORR, PFS, and OS with pembrolizumab. Participants with TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb       showed a trend toward increased benefit with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy.       No association was seen between BRCAm/HRD status and treatment response. These       findings suggest a positive association between TILs, Tcell(inf)GEP, and TMB with       clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic TNBC receiving pembrolizumab.

10.2967/jnumed.125.270190	Multicentric Matched-Pair Analysis of Long-Term Hematotoxicity of Peptide       Receptor Radionuclide Therapy in Patients Postsplenectomy.	Steinhelfer L, Jungmann F, Endroes L, Lanzafame H, Hermann K, Pfob CH, Lapa C, Hartrampf PE, Dörrler AL, Buck AK, Götze K, Wenzel P, Geisler F, Walter R, Haneder E, Lohöfer F, Haller B, Braren R, Eiber M	Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is an approved       treatment for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Although the therapy is       effective, hematologic toxicity, particularly leukopenia, remains a significant       concern. The spleen, which accumulates radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, may       play a critical role in modulating this toxicity. This study investigates whether       patients undergoing PRRT after splenectomy exhibit lower hematologic toxicity.       Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included 68 patients with       metastatic NETs treated with PRRT between 2009 and 2022. Splenectomized patients       (n = 34) were matched to nonsplenectomized patients on the basis of age, sex,       tumor location, grading, metastatic pattern, and treatment cycles. Hematologic       parameters (leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and platelets) were       assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 mo after PRRT. Hematotoxicity was graded using       Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Statistical analyses included t       test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher exact test, with an α of 0.05 and       Bonferroni adjustment applied. Results: Splenectomized patients had significantly       lower rates of leukopenia, with a mean decline of 12.8% in leukocyte count at 24       mo versus 47.2% in nonsplenectomized patients (P < 0.001), and a higher median       absolute leukocyte count (7.2 vs. 4.2 × 10³/mm³, P < 0.001). Leukopenia occurred       in 2 splenectomized patients compared with 20 in the control group (P < 0.001).       Lymphocyte decline was also less pronounced, with higher absolute counts at 24       mo. Platelet counts were consistently higher postsplenectomy, although relative       changes over time were not significant. Neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels       remained comparable between groups. Conclusion: Splenectomy appears to reduce       leukopenia and improve hematologic tolerability in NET patients undergoing PRRT,       highlighting the spleen's role in leukocyte regulation. These patients may better       tolerate intensified PRRT regimens, including additional cycles or reinduction,       with minimal toxicity. This is particularly relevant for patients with pancreatic       NETs, who frequently undergo splenectomy and face a poorer prognosis. Prospective       studies are needed to further clarify the spleen's impact on PRRT-related       hematotoxicity and guide treatment optimization.

10.1007/s13577-025-01294-9	Elucidating the risk factors and oncogene drivers of acute myeloid leukemia.	Sanya DRA, Onésime D	The hematopoietic system is critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis       but is also implicated in various pathologies. The magnitude of hematopoietic       responses to perturbations or diseases exhibits significant inter-individual       variability, underscoring the need to identify predictors and determinants of       blood responsiveness in humans. These reactions are shaped not only by genetic       factors but also by epigenetic modifications and environmental effects.       Elucidating baseline predictors of hematopoietic responses and their molecular       underpinnings is of particular interest in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), given       their potential to inform malignancy immunotherapy. Due to limited understanding       of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving diverse AML subtypes in       pediatric and adult patients, coupled with an increasing prevalence of refractory       or relapsed hematological malignancies, this review highlights underexplored       prognostic biomarkers, their molecular mechanisms, and their potential clinical       utility in optimizing therapeutic strategies for improved patient survival. It       examines recent advances in AML research and vaccine development, focusing on       efforts to address highly aggressive and rare AML subtypes driven by aberrantly       activated transcription factors. The review also addresses clinical implications       for overall survival and treatment response, as well as promising vaccine       candidates. Additionally, it highlights newly identified mutations and high-risk       molecular markers that could enhance risk stratification for early disease       progression, identifying patients who may benefit from allogeneic stem cell       transplantation or enrollment in clinical trials.

10.1016/j.bioactmat.2025.09.016	Remodeling of senescent macrophages in synovium alleviates trauma- and       aging-induced osteoarthritis.	Liu Y, Duan J, Dang Y, Hao R, Wang H, Tan E, Wang R, Li Y, Zhang S, Wang Y, Lv J, Qi Y, Zhang X, Cheng Y	Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most concerned aging-related diseases in the       worldwide, yet the investigation of immune senescence in joint and related       therapies are still poorly identified. Single-cell sequencing analysis and       immunofluorescence of OA synovium reveal increased senescent macrophages in       trauma-induced OA compared to controls. Importantly, senescent macrophages in OA       synovium showed enhanced M1 polarization, mitochondrial damage and impaired       efferocytosis, which could lead to increased senescence-associated secretory       phenotypes (SASPs) in the joint and further exacerbate OA. Hence, a novel       senotherapeutic nanoparticle is developed using chloroquine (CQ)-bearing polymers       (pCQ) for targeted delivery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to synovial       macrophages, termed as pCQ/SOD. The nanoparticle achieves efficient intracellular       delivery of SOD to synovial macrophages. RNA-seq results reveal that pCQ/SOD       nanoparticle inhibits macrophage senescence via p53 and cellular senescence       signaling pathway, further reprograms M1-to-M2 repolarization. Furthermore, the       delivered SOD inhibits BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane       permeabilization (MOMP) which further reduces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release       and SASP secretion, while pCQ promotes macrophage efferocytosis against apoptotic       cells via STAT3/ADAM17/MerTK signaling. As a result, intraarticular injection of       pCQ/SOD nanoparticles in mice successfully alleviates not only trauma-induced OA,       but aging-induced OA as well. The developed senotherapeutic nanoparticle in this       study offers an effective approach for remodeling of senescent macrophages in       synovium and a promising therapeutic strategy for OA treatment.

10.1038/s41409-025-02729-5	Comparison of single-unit umbilical cord blood transplantation and haploidentical       transplantation using posttransplant cyclophosphamide during first complete       remission of acute myeloid leukemia.	Yanada M, Yamasaki S, Mizuno S, Sugita J, Fujino T, Misaki Y, Tanaka M, Uchida N, Onizuka M, Doki N, Ota S, Sawa M, Kawakita T, Hasegawa Y, Nakamae H, Ishiwata K, Hiramoto N, Ishimaru F, Kanda J, Ohbiki M, Atsuta Y, Nakasone H, Konuma T	Choosing an optimal alternative donor is an important clinical concern in       allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In Japan, single-unit       umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has been widely used in the last two       decades, whereas HCT from HLA-haploidentical related donors (haplo-HCT) has been       increasingly used following the advent of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY)       for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. This registry-based study aimed       to compare outcomes between single-unit UCBT (n = 848) and PTCY-based haplo-HCT       (n = 241) performed during first complete remission in patients with acute       myeloid leukemia. UCBT was associated with a lower likelihood of engraftment       (P < 0.001), a higher risk of grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 acute GVHD (P = 0.003       each), and a lower risk of extensive chronic GVHD (P = 0.048). The UCBT and       haplo-HCT groups did not significantly differ in 3-year probabilities of overall       survival (68% versus 69%, P = 0.686), GVHD/relapse-free survival (55% versus 54%,       P = 0.866), relapse (14% versus 16%, P = 0.463), and non-relapse mortality (21%       versus 19%, P = 0.403), respectively, which were confirmed with multivariate       analysis. These results indicate that both procedures should be considered viable       options for patients lacking a matched donor.	Bone marrow transplantation	05/10/2025
10.1002/advs.202508576	cGAS Inhibits ALDH2 to Suppress Lipid Droplet Function and Regulate MASLD       Progression.	Wang Y, Deng Y, Chen J, Hahn Q, Umbaugh DS, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Rowe SE, Li L, Herring LE, Conlon BP, Miao EA, Damania B, Diehl AM, Liu P	Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor essential for host       defense against microbial infections, but its role beyond innate immunity remains       unclear. Here, a non-canonical function of cGAS in regulating aldehyde metabolism       and lipid homeostasis is identified. This is demonstrated that cGAS directly       binds to and suppresses ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2), a key enzyme in ethanol       metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Loss of cGAS activates ALDH2, thereby       enhancing ethanol tolerance in mice. Elevated ALDH2 activity upon cGAS loss       increases aldehyde conversion into acetyl-CoA, promoting histone acetylation and       transcription of lipid synthesis genes, which drives lipid droplet accumulation       in cells and in cGas(-/-) mouse livers. These lipid droplets confer resistance to       ferroptosis but simultaneously induce ER stress, impairing STING (stimulator of       interferon genes) activation. Functionally, cGas(-/-) mice fed with a modified       high-fat diet develop exacerbated metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic       liver disease (MASLD), characterized by excessive lipid droplet accumulation in       livers compared to wild-type controls. In human MASLD patient cohorts, increased       cGAS but reduced ALDH2 mRNA expression is observed relative to healthy       individuals. Together, this findings uncover a previously unrecognized role of       cGAS in metabolic regulation, independent of its innate immune function. By       suppressing ALDH2, cGAS controls lipid droplet biogenesis and stress responses,       with direct implications for MASLD pathogenesis.

10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.4091	Reevaluating Nonoperative Management for Pediatric Uncomplicated Acute       Appendicitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Faria I, Cintra ACG, de Oliveira LGAM, Squizzato F, Maia AS, Cunha AG, Radhakrishnan RS	Nonoperative management (NOM) has emerged as a potential alternative       to surgery for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children; however, while       short-term outcomes are often favorable, concerns remain about treatment       durability, complication rates, and long-term failure. An updated meta-analysis       of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may help clarify the comparative safety and       effectiveness of NOM vs appendectomy. To evaluate the safety and       effectiveness of NOM compared with appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis in       children using the highest level of available evidence. A       systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science was       conducted from inception through March 2025 to identify randomized clinical       trials comparing NOM with surgical management in pediatric patients. RCTs comparing NOM vs surgical management in pediatric patients       younger than 18 years were included. Nonrandomized and quasi-randomized studies       were excluded. Data were extracted following       Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.       Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. Risk of bias was       assessed independently by multiple reviewers. Trial sequential analysis was       performed to determine whether the evidence was sufficiently robust and       conclusive. The primary outcomes were treatment       failure and treatment success in 1 year and major complications (Clavien-Dindo       grade ≥IIIb). Secondary outcomes included time to return to school and time to       return to normal activity. Of 1246 studies screened, 7 RCTs, including       1480 pediatric patients, met inclusion criteria. Treatment failure was       significantly higher in the NOM group than in the appendectomy group at 1 year       (risk ratio [RR], 4.97; 95% CI, 3.57-6.91; I2 = 0.0%). Treatment success was       significantly lower in the NOM group at 1 year (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75;       I2 = 31.1%). Major complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb or worse       were more frequent in the NOM group (RR, 33.37; 95% CI, 7.89-141.05; I2 = 9.5%).       Appendicitis recurred at a rate of 18.47 events/100 observations (95% CI,       12.62-25.07 events/100 observations; I2 = 48.5%) among patients who received NOM.       NOM, compared with appendectomy, was associated with a modestly faster return to       school (mean difference, -1.36 days; 95% CI, -2.64 to -0.08 days; P = .04;       I2 = 57.7%) and return to normal activities (-4.93 days; 95% CI, -8.68 to -1.19       days; P = .01; I2 = 87.2%), although this may be offset by subsequent       readmissions or reintervention. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated the       robustness and conclusiveness of primary outcomes. In       contrast to earlier studies, this meta-analysis found significantly higher       treatment failure and major complication rates within a year with NOM among       children and adolescents. The meta-analysis provides pediatricians and pediatric       surgeons with up-to-date data to inform shared decision-making with families and       encourage individualized, patient-centered treatment.

Cheung JF, Hunt BG, Wahed S, Cheng E, Connolly KA, Venkatesan S, Loza JL, Bansal I, Fagerberg E, Kessler EA, Riffard C, Buck J, Attanasio J, Borr ER, Wei W, William I, Fitzgerald B, Joshi NS	T cells edit tumors by eliminating neoantigen-expressing tumor cells. Yet, how       and when this is achieved remains uncertain. Using a murine sarcoma model with       fluorescent neoantigens, we found that tumors developed later and in fewer T       cell-sufficient mice (∼53% penetrance) than T cell-deficient mice (∼100%). With T       cells, all emergent tumor cells had silenced neoantigens, but neoantigen-negative       tumor cells were also present in every T cell-deficient mouse. This suggested       silencing was necessary but not sufficient for outgrowth. Genetic removal of       neoantigens restored tumor penetrance if implemented on day 5 post-tumor       initiation, but not day 10, because CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells infiltrated the       tissue and eliminated most neoantigen-positive and -negative tumor cells within 8       days. Single-cell analyses on day-7 tumors showed oncogenic changes including       increased proliferation and T cell-dependent upregulation of the IFNγ-response       gene Cd274 (PD-L1). T cell-depletion rescued both neoantigen-positive and       -negative cells, while IFNγ blockade rescued only negative cells. This shows that       T cells efficiently edit sarcomas of neoantigens and prevent early tumors via       IFNγ-independent and IFNγ-dependent (bystander) mechanisms.	Cancer cell	02/10/2025
10.1093/femsre/fux005	Chemical ecology of antibiotic production by actinomycetes.	van der Meij A, Worsley SF, Hutchings MI, van Wezel GP	Actinomycetes are a diverse family of filamentous bacteria that produce a       plethora of natural products relevant for agriculture, biotechnology and       medicine, including the majority of the antibiotics we use in the clinic. Rather       than as free-living bacteria, many actinomycetes have evolved to live in       symbiosis with among others plants, fungi, insects and sponges. As a common       theme, these organisms profit from the natural products and enzymes produced by       the actinomycetes, for example, for protection against pathogenic microbes, for       growth promotion or for the degradation of complex natural polymers such as       lignocellulose. At the same time, the actinomycetes benefit from the resources of       the hosts they interact with. Evidence is accumulating that these interactions       control the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters and have played a major role       in the evolution of the high chemical diversity of actinomycete-produced       secondary metabolites. Many of the biosynthetic gene clusters for antibiotics are       poorly expressed under laboratory conditions, but they are likely expressed in       response to host-specific demands. Here, we review the environmental triggers and       cues that control natural product formation by actinomycetes and provide pointers       as to how these insights may be harnessed for drug discovery.

Wang K, Feng J, Yu H, Cheng Y, Xiang Y, Liu Z, Qin Y, Liu E, Shan Y, Fan C, Zhai J, He D, Zhou H, Tang Y, Shi J, Guo W, Yan M, Yu L, Kudo M, Cheng S	Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for       intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet its efficacy as a       standalone therapy remains suboptimal. This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2100049829)       evaluated the feasibility and safety of TACE combined with atezolizumab and       bevacizumab in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. Participants received TACE       followed by atezolizumab and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable       toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR)       assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.       Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival       (OS), ORR by modified RECIST (mRECIST), disease control rate (DCR), time to       response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), and adverse events (AEs). Between       August 21, 2021 and April 10, 2023, 45 patients were enrolled. As of the data       cutoff on September 30, 2024, the median follow-up was 26.7 months. The ORR was       47% per RECIST v1.1 and 67% per mRECIST. Median PFS was 17.9 months, and median       OS was 33.0 months. The DCR was 87% (RECIST v1.1) and 91% (mRECIST). Median TTR       was 11.9 weeks (RECIST v1.1) and 4.9 weeks (mRECIST), with median DOR of 36.6       weeks (RECIST v1.1) and 44.4 weeks (mRECIST). Of the 45 patients, 44 experienced       AEs of any grade, with 20 reporting grade 3-4 AEs; no grade 5 AEs were observed.       TACE combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab appears safe and feasible for       intermediate-stage HCC, supporting further investigation in larger studies.

10.1038/hgv.2015.60	Genomic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease in five families with multiple       affected individuals.	Stittrich AB, Ashworth J, Shi M, Robinson M, Mauldin D, Brunkow ME, Biswas S, Kim JM, Kwon KS, Jung JU, Galas D, Serikawa K, Duerr RH, Guthery SL, Peschon J, Hood L, Roach JC, Glusman G	Currently, the best clinical predictor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is       family history. Over 163 sequence variants have been associated with IBD in       genome-wide association studies, but they have weak effects and explain only a       fraction of the observed heritability. It is expected that additional variants       contribute to the genomic architecture of IBD, possibly including rare variants       with effect sizes larger than the identified common variants. Here we applied a       family study design and sequenced 38 individuals from five families, under the       hypothesis that families with multiple IBD-affected individuals harbor one or       more risk variants that (i) are shared among affected family members, (ii) are       rare and (iii) have substantial effect on disease development. Our analysis       revealed not only novel candidate risk variants but also high polygenic risk       scores for common known risk variants in four out of the five families.       Functional analysis of our top novel variant in the remaining family, a rare       missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, suggests that it leads to       increased nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB)       signaling. We conclude that an accumulation of common weak-effect variants       accounts for the high incidence of IBD in most, but not all families we analyzed       and that a family study design can identify novel rare variants conferring risk       for IBD with potentially large effect size, such as the TRIM11 p.H414Y mutation.

10.1038/s41386-025-02227-8	Inflammatory mechanisms contribute to long-term cognitive deficits induced by       perinatal asphyxia via interleukin-1.	Kelemen H, Balla GY, Demeter K, Sipos E, Buzás-Kaizler A, Biró L, Aliczki M, Orsolits B, Kerényi Á, Balogh Z, Pászthy-Szabó B, Pejtsik D, Hegyi L, Szigeti K, Máthé D, Padmanabhan P, Bödör C, Fekete A, Szabó M, Kaila K, Dénes Á, Mikics É	Perinatal asphyxia remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality and a major       contributor to permanent neurological deficits. Even mild cases can result in       long-term neurodevelopmental, cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disorders.       However, the mechanisms underlying asphyxia-induced hypoxic-ischaemic brain       injury remain poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted       interventions during the critical early plastic period. To explore the       behavioural and molecular outcomes of perinatal asphyxia that may model important       aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders observed in humans, we utilised a       translationally relevant, non-invasive oxygen deprivation model of asphyxia in       postnatal day 7 rats. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of asphyxia-induced       changes, integrating neurobehavioural profiling (evaluating cognitive, emotional,       social and neuromotor functions), microglial morphology analysis, neuroimaging,       stress hormone measurement and whole-transcriptome sequencing techniques to       elucidate the acute and long-term functional consequences. Consistent with       clinical observations, the extensive functional assessment revealed distinct       sex-dependent effects, including increased anxiety and impulsivity, attention       deficits and impaired inhibitory control, which were observed exclusively in       males, with no apparent sensorimotor deficits. This phenotype resembling       attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult rats was associated with       a lasting increase in inhibitory bouton densities in the medial prefrontal       cortex. The development of an acute inflammatory response after perinatal       asphyxia marked by phenotypic transformation of microglia, paralleled brain       perfusion and stress hormone changes. Notably, microglial changes were mitigated       by the blockade of proinflammatory interleukin-1 signalling via systemic IL-1       receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) administration in a therapeutically relevant time       window. Importantly, early blockade of proinflammatory responses was able to       prevent cognitive deficits in adulthood and normalise inhibitory bouton       densities. RNA sequencing analysis revealed asphyxia-induced dysregulation of       molecular pathways targeting GABAergic signalling, potentially contributing to       subsequent morphological and neuropsychiatric alterations. IL-1RA treatment       appeared to engage distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, rather than merely       reversing these disruptions in the acute post-asphyxia period. Collectively,       these findings demonstrate that perinatal asphyxia induces marked behavioural       deficits in attention and inhibitory control, paralleled by lasting inhibitory       and epigenetic dysregulation, preceded by acute induction of microglia-driven       inflammatory processes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Systemic IL-1RA       administration may represent a promising therapeutic opportunity to prevent       long-term cognitive impairments caused by perinatal asphyxia.

10.1016/j.bcp.2025.117376	Cancer-associated transporters: Molecular drivers and drug delivery gateways.	Khan A, Biswas S, Garg M, Sengupta S	Membrane transporters are critical regulators of cellular homeostasis, mediating       the uptake and efflux of nutrients, ions, and drugs. In cancer, their expression       is frequently reprogrammed to support enhanced growth, survival, metabolic       rewiring, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. Among these several solute       carrier (SLC) transporters such as glucose transporters (GLUTs), monocarboxylate       transporters (MCTs), and the sodium/iodine symporter (NIS) also facilitate       selective delivery of radiopharmaceuticals, making them attractive therapeutic       targets. The tumor suppressor p53 known for its central role in genome stability       and apoptosis, also regulates a broad spectrum of membrane transporters. However,       oncogenic mutations or structural conversion into amyloids can disrupt this       regulatory network, leading to altered transporter expression and multidrug       resistance. Despite growing interest, the transcriptional and       post-transcriptional control of transporters by wt, mutant, and amyloid forms of       p53 remains underexplored. In this review, we systematically characterize the       p53-mediated regulation of diverse transporter classes involved in the transport       of sugar, amino acids, metal ions, lipids along with ABC transporter functions       and multidrug resistance. We highlight how cancer cells exploit transporters such       as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), LAT1, GLUT1, MCTs, and NIS for metabolic advantage and       survival. We also examine therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating transporter       function using CRISPR/Cas9, small-molecule inhibitors, siRNA, and       nanoparticle-based co-delivery systems. In particular, LAT1 inhibition       demonstrates potential to starve tumors of essential nutrients. Ultimately, we       propose that dual targeting of p53 aberrations and membrane transporters through       synthetic biology and precision delivery approaches could restore       chemosensitivity and suppress tumor progression, offering promising avenues for       personalized cancer therapy.

Fibrosis, an accumulation of collagen-rich extracellular       matrix in response to injury, is a hallmark of heart disease, but clinical agents       that can interfere with the fibrotic pathway do not yet exist. Here we show that       ANTXR1/TEM8, a pathology-induced transmembrane protein required for collagen       removal, exacerbates injury in multiple models of heart failure. Genetic       disruption of Antxr1 and treatment with human neutralizing antibodies prevented       heart deterioration following acute myocardial infarction. ANTXR1 pharmacological       blockade also improved heart function in models of pressure overload and       obesity-induced heart disease with preserved ejection fraction. Improved heart       function was accompanied by enhanced exercise tolerance. Mechanistic studies       revealed an ANTXR1-antibody-driven improvement in post-infarct scar formation       followed by attenuation of late-stage, chronic TGFβ-mediated extracellular matrix       remodeling. Thus, ANTXR1-mediated collagen turnover during heart failure is both       maladaptive and druggable, providing avenues for therapeutic intervention.	Nature cardiovascular research	02/10/2025
10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.008	The transcriptional repressor BLIMP1 enforces TCF-1-dependent and -independent       restriction of the memory fate of CD8(+) T cells.	Murphy MK, McCullen M, Deffenbaugh JL, Chen AY, Pai J, Daniel B, Yousif A, Raju S, Hsiung S, Wang Z, Ghoneim HE, Satpathy AT, Colonna M, Oltz EM, Egawa T	During differentiation of CD8(+) T cells, the transcription factors TCF-1 and       Blimp1 control progenitor and terminally differentiated states, respectively.       Here, we examined the hierarchy and functional consequences of cross-regulation       between these factors. We identified two Blimp1-bound cis-regulatory elements,       Tcf7(+22kb) and Tcf7(+17kb), that enforced Tcf7 silencing in a context-specific       manner during both acute and chronic responses. Deletion of these elements       decoupled Tcf7 repression from effector differentiation but did not rewire       effector T cells to a memory state or prevent the acquisition of phenotypic       hallmarks of exhaustion. However, combined ablation of Prdm1 and Tcf7 preserved a       memory surface phenotype despite defects in secondary expansion. Thus, the       anti-proliferative and pro-differentiative effects of Blimp1 in effector or       exhausted CD8(+) T cells represent mechanistically distinct modules, wherein       repression of Tcf7 limits proliferative capacity but not memory or progenitor       specification.

10.1186/s13054-025-05491-8	Rethinking post-sepsis syndrome: linking cellular dysfunction to the clinical       picture.	Gorecki GP, Bodor A, Novac MB, Costea DG, Costea DO, Costea AC, Grasa CN, Tomescu DR	"Post-sepsis syndrome (PSS) encompasses a range of long-term complications,       including immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and neuromuscular       impairment, that persist beyond the resolution of the acute septic episode. While       these clinical phenotypes are increasingly recognized, the underlying molecular       mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly       in the form of persistent mitochondrial senescence, is emerging as a potential       unifying factor driving multiple PSS trajectories. Accumulating evidence suggests       that damaged mitochondria not only lose their bioenergetic capacity but also       actively contribute to chronic immune and inflammatory signalling. Based on this,       we propose a dual-intervention strategy (""mitochondrial flush"") which involves       the coordinated elimination of senescent mitochondria and stimulation of       mitochondrial biogenesis. The regenerative component, supported by established       preclinical research on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma       Coactivator 1-Alpha (PGC-1α) activation, represents a partially developed       therapeutic arm, while the selective clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria       remains an area of active investigation. This concept raises important questions       regarding regenerative capacity, therapeutic timing, and cellular resilience       following critical illness. We further propose a working definition of PSS as a       state of persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly driven by ongoing       oxidative stress, which may underlie a broader range of clinical phenotypes than       currently recognized. A deeper understanding of mitochondrial quality control may       offer a new therapeutic framework for reversing the chronic physiological decline       observed in sepsis survivors."

10.1126/science.7624776	Effects of the obese gene product on body weight regulation in ob/ob mice.	Pelleymounter MA, Cullen MJ, Baker MB, Hecht R, Winters D, Boone T, Collins F	C57BL/6J mice with a mutation in the obese (ob) gene are obese, diabetic, and       exhibit reduced activity, metabolism, and body temperature. Daily intraperitoneal       injection of these mice with recombinant OB protein lowered their body weight,       percent body fat, food intake, and serum concentrations of glucose and insulin.       In addition, metabolic rate, body temperature, and activity levels were increased       by this treatment. None of these parameters was altered beyond the level observed       in lean controls, suggesting that the OB protein normalized the metabolic status       of the ob/ob mice. Lean animals injected with OB protein maintained a smaller       weight loss throughout the 28-day study and showed no changes in any of the       metabolic parameters. These data suggest that the OB protein regulates body       weight and fat deposition through effects on metabolism and appetite.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	28/07/1995
10.1111/j.1465-0691.2004.1007.x	Antimicrobial drug development--the past, the present, and the future.	Powers JH	Antimicrobial resistance has been an issue since the introduction into clinical       use of the first agents in the 1940s. Although the discovery and development of       new classes of antimicrobials through the 1960s presented an array of treatment       options, these options for some serious and life-threatening infectious diseases       may now be more limited. This paper examines the history of antimicrobial       development, showing how the challenges in discovering new classes of drugs have       been with us for the last 40 years. The present state of antimicrobial discovery       and development is shaped by these challenges as well as by the economic       realities of the pharmaceutical industry. This paper also discusses some of the       regulatory considerations in antimicrobial drug development, and presents some       potential solutions to the challenges inherent in antimicrobial drug development,       including steps taken by the US Food and Drug Administration to streamline the       drug review process for antimicrobial agents while maintaining the standards       necessary to protect and promote the health of the public.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1629060	The role of the tuft cell-interleukin-25 axis in the pathogenesis of inflammatory       bowel disease.	Tao Z, Li L, Zhang Y, Tang Y, Zhang S, Yang H, Jiang G, Zhang R, Wu Z, He M	"Emerging evidence highlights the tuft cell-Interleukin-25 (IL-25) axis       (tuft/IL-25 axis) as a critical orchestrator bridging luminal stimuli and       intestinal immunity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which encompasses       Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This review synergises current       understanding of how dysregulation within this axis contributes to IBD       pathogenesis, arising from disrupted immune homeostasis involving aberrant       microbiota responses, genetic susceptibility, and immune pathway dysregulation.       Central to this axis, intestinal tuft cells act as chemosensory epithelial       sentinels, differentiating in response to microbial and metabolic cues to become       the primary source of IL-25. IL-25, signaling via IL-17RB, engages innate and       adaptive immune cells, particularly group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). While       IL-33-responsive homeostatic ILC2s (nILC2s) promote mucosal repair, IL-25-driven       inflammatory ILC2s (iILC2s) amplify inflammation, positioning them as pivotal       effectors. Critically, IL-25 exhibits a context-dependent ""double-edged"" role:       engagement with IL-25R(+) T cells and modulation of downstream signaling can       exert anti-inflammatory effects and enhance barrier integrity, yet dysregulation       drives pro-inflammatory injury. The axis is dynamically regulated by diverse       luminal factors: helminth infection activates the tuft-ILC2 circuit, inducing       protective type 2 immunity; specific microbial metabolites (e.g., succinate,       SCFAs) modulate its activity; and viral infections can disrupt homeostasis by       remodeling tuft cell function. Dysregulation of the tuft/IL-25 axis, driven by       infections, microbial metabolite fluctuations, or environmental factors       (including regional variations in helminth exposure linked to the hygiene       hypothesis), is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to IBD       pathogenesis. Consequently, precisely regulating this axis to harness its       beneficial effects while mitigating its detrimental potential represents a       promising therapeutic frontier. Future strategies should integrate microbiota       remodeling, targeted metabolite interventions, and potentially virus-directed       therapies. Furthermore, deeper investigation into the impact of geographical       environmental factors on this axis and IBD risk is warranted. Ultimately,       multi-pathway approaches aimed at restoring the ""immune-microbiota-epithelial""       triad via reprogramming the tuft/IL-25 axis hold significant promise for novel       IBD management."

10.7150/thno.120824	EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 links microbial inosine loss to depression: a gut-brain       epigenetic switch.	Zhu S, Li X, Yu Y, Han X, Yang F, Lu M, Dai G, Guo L, Xu D	"Background: Depression, the second most prevalent neurological disorder globally,       affects over 300 million people and presents an urgent public health challenge.       While gut microbiota dysbiosis is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to       depression, the molecular mechanisms linking microbial imbalance to brain       dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods: We investigated the role of EZH2 in       gut microbiota-induced depressive behaviors in mice using the chronic       unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), fecal microbiota transplantation, and       conditional knockout of EZH2. CUT&Tag sequencing was employed to analyze       EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 epigenetic reprogramming. Untargeted metabolomics and       luciferase reporter assays were used to identify metabolites that upregulate EZH2       expression. 16S rRNA sequencing combined with metabolic tracing was conducted to       trace the microbial origin of inosine. Additionally, natural compound screening       identified coumaric acid (CA) as a novel EZH2-targeting degrader. Results:       Conditional knockout of neuronal Ezh2 abolishes microbiota-induced depressive       behaviors and neuronal apoptosis. Mechanistically, reduced abundance of specific       microbiota (f_Lachnospiraceae, f_Oscillospiraceae, and f_Erysipelotricaceae)       leads to inosine depletion. This depletion subsequently elevates EZH2       transcriptional activity by increasing H3K9ac modification at its locus, mediated       through attenuation of the A2aR-cAMP-PKA-CREB-HDAC3 signaling axis. Subsequently,       EZH2 silences serotonergic synapse-related genes (e.g., Tph2, Htr2a, Htr6) via       H3K27me3 reprogramming, ultimately driving depressive behaviors and neuronal       apoptosis in mice. Importantly, CA is identified as a first-in-class EZH2       degrader that binds lysine residues K623/K646 and recruits UBE3A for proteasomal       degradation. CA treatment restores synaptic integrity and reverses depressive       behaviors with minimal toxicity. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings define       a novel ""microbiota-inosine-EZH2"" axis in depression pathogenesis and highlight       EZH2 degradation as a promising therapeutic strategy for microbiota-associated       neuropsychiatric disorders."

Recently, bi-allelic mutations       in SLC31A1 have been associated with a new neurodevelopmental disorder. This       study presents clinical, genetic, and biochemical findings from 13 new cases       across 10 families worldwide. RNA sequencing evaluated gene expression, and       Western blotting assessed copper transporter 1 protein levels. Additionally,       mitochondrial respiratory capacity was measured via high-resolution respirometry.       Affected individuals exhibited a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by       early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, severe neurodevelopmental delay and       hypotonia, with high mortality. Neuroimaging revealed significant brain atrophy       and white matter abnormalities. Genetic analysis identified bi-allelic SLC31A1       variants, predominantly p.His120Gln in six cases and p.(Arg102Cys/His) in three       cases. Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrated impaired       mitochondrial respiration. This study significantly broadens the clinical       spectrum of this recently described syndrome, presenting as a severe       developmental encephalopathy with high mortality risk, and suggests mitochondrial       dysfunction as a potential pathomechanism. These findings contribute to the       mounting evidence linking copper transporter 1 dysfunction to neurodegeneration,       underscoring the urgency for further therapeutic investigations.

Zhang C, He Y, Zhan X, Yu J, Xu S, Zhang Q, Qiu R, Wang X, Gao Z, Huang M, Long W, Liu Q, Zhao W	Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits marked heterogeneity, yet therapeutic strategies       effectively targeting this variability remain inadequately developed. Here we       employed single-cell CUT&Tag analysis to investigate H3K27ac modifications,       uncovering pronounced heterogeneity within the core regulatory circuitry (CRC) of       GBM. Notably, we observed heterogeneous condensation states of CRC factors,       particularly HOXB3, which are shaped by its intrinsically disordered regions and       interactions with RUNX1, driving the phenotypic manifestations. Leveraging these       findings, we synthesized the peptide P621-R9, which effectively disrupted HOXB3       condensation, altered chromatin structure and reduced transcription at       super-enhancer-associated oncogenic sites in GBM cells exhibiting HOXB3       condensation. Treatment with P621-R9 selectively diminished tumourigenic       potential in GBM patient-derived xenograft models characterized by HOXB3       condensates, but showed no efficacy in the models lacking these condensates.       These results highlight the critical role of CRC condensation in GBM       heterogeneity and suggest that peptide-based targeting of distinct GBM       subpopulations could represent an avenue for therapeutic exploration.

10.1002/14651858.CD016192.pub2	Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies inreducing COVID-19 cases,       hospitalisations, and deaths.	Saif-Ur-Rahman KM, Nurdin N, Movsisyan A, Kothari K, Gleeson C, Conway T, Tierney M, Taneri E, Mulholland D, Tricco AC, Dinnes J, Devane D	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has       substantially affected daily life. Sustainable testing practices are essential to       balance the resource demands of widespread testing with the need to reduce the       health impacts of COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of specific testing       strategies for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in reducing COVID-19       cases, hospitalisations, and deaths remains uncertain. To evaluate       the effectiveness of different SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies in reducing COVID-19       cases, hospitalisations, and deaths amongst suspected cases and asymptomatic       individuals. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase       (Elsevier), Europe PMC, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization       (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also conducted       reference checks, citation searches, and contacted study authors to identify       eligible studies. The most recent search was conducted on 07 October 2024.       We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs),       non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-and-after       studies (CBA), matched cohort studies, and observational studies with a       comparison group involving suspected or asymptomatic individuals. Eligible       studies compared testing strategy versus no testing or standard care or usual       practice; one testing strategy with another, such as antigen-detecting rapid       diagnostic tests (RDTs) versus nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT),       including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); home-based       versus provider-administered testing; one-time testing versus repeated testing at       different frequencies; and targeted testing versus widespread testing.       Combinations of these components were also considered. In this review, we define       'SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy' as a complex intervention comprising multiple       varying components, including test type (e.g. NAAT, antigen-detecting RDT),       sample type (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab, saliva), target population (e.g.       symptomatic, contacts), setting (e.g. home, clinic, congregate), frequency of       testing (e.g. one-time, weekly, daily), and response protocol (e.g. isolation,       confirmatory testing, treatment). We excluded single-arm studies, reviews,       theses, editorials, letters, commentaries, studies reported solely in abstract       form, laboratory or animal studies, mathematical modelling studies, and       diagnostic test accuracy studies. Our critical outcomes were: COVID-19       cases avoided (reduction in new cases); COVID-19-related hospitalisations avoided       (reduction in hospital admissions); COVID-19-related deaths avoided (reduction in       mortality); and serious adverse events related to testing, including unnecessary       interventions, employment impacts, isolation effects, and psychological harms.       We used the Risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool to assess the risk of bias       in RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias in NRSIs, CBA studies,       and matched cohort studies. As a meta-analysis was not       feasible due to the nature of the data, we applied Synthesis Without       Meta-analysis (SWiM) methods. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each       outcome using the GRADE approach. We included 21 studies (10       RCTs and 11 NRSIs) with 13,312,327 participants. Among these, 13       studies-comprising eight RCTs and five NRSIs-either reported one or more       prespecified outcomes (four studies), provided relevant information through proxy       measurements (five studies), or supplied information following author       correspondence (four studies). We present the prioritised       comparisons and critical outcomes. For the comparison testing strategy versus no       testing or standard care or usual practice, one included study measured two       critical outcomes. The study did not measure the other critical outcomes:       COVID-19 cases avoided, and serious adverse events related to testing. No studies       measured any critical outcomes for the other prioritised comparison:       antigen-detecting RDT versus NAAT testing. Benefits and harms of testing strategy       versus no testing or standard care or usual practice One observational study with       a comparison group, conducted in a long-term care facility in Israel, compared       weekly SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing with no testing and measured two of our critical       outcomes. Based on the analysis, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect       of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing on reducing hospitalisation (decrease in the       hospitalisation rate from 13.59% to 11.41%; 1 study, 162,205 participants, very       low-certainty evidence) and mortality (33.8% decrease in expected mortality; 1       study, 162,205 participants, very low-certainty evidence) compared to no testing.       We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of methodological       limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. AUTHORS' The available       data are of very low-certainty. Only one of the 21 included studies reported       hospitalisations or deaths; therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the       effects of testing strategy versus no testing on reducing hospitalisation and       mortality. No studies evaluated other critical outcomes i.e. COVID-19 cases       avoided, and serious adverse events related to testing. Future research should       aim for consistency and relevance by using clearly defined outcomes, preferably       based on a standardised core outcome set. A qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)       would help identify barriers and facilitators to routine SARS-CoV-2 testing in       healthcare settings, which could help inform intervention development. The QES       would explore factors affecting the implementation of routine testing, drawing on       the perspectives of healthcare providers, patients, and other interest holders.

10.1080/14779072.2025.2570839	Novel therapies for lowering low-density lipoprotein levels for atherosclerotic       cardiovascular disease prevention: reaching the target where others have failed.	Dziewierz A, Bobrowska B, Streb W, Pelliccia F, Bartuś S, Rajtar-Salwa R	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a leading       cause of global morbidity and mortality, with elevated low-density lipoprotein       cholesterol (LDL-C) established as a primary causal factor. Despite foundational       therapies, many high-risk patients fail to achieve optimal LDL-C targets. This review examines established LDL-C lowering agents (statins and       ezetimibe), detailing their mechanisms and limitations, including statin       intolerance and residual cardiovascular risk. We provide a comprehensive analysis       of novel therapeutic options, including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin       type 9 (PCSK9) modulators (monoclonal antibodies, small interfering RNA, and       emerging oral agents), ATP-citrate lyase inhibitors (bempedoic acid),       angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibitors, and pioneering gene-editing       technologies. We discuss mechanisms of action, pivotal efficacy data (LDL-C       reduction and plaque modification), safety profiles, and key findings from major       cardiovascular outcome trials. Novel LDL-C lowering therapies       represent a paradigm shift, offering unprecedented efficacy in reducing LDL-C and       mitigating ASCVD risk. However, significant challenges remain, including       cost-effectiveness concerns, the need for long-term safety data, profound global       disparities in access, and persistent clinical inertia that impedes real-world       implementation even in well-resourced healthcare systems. Future research should       prioritize personalized lipid management, combination strategies, and development       of durable, cost-effective solutions to reduce the residual ASCVD burden.

10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00239-5	Taladegib for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ENV-IPF-101): a       multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial.	Maher TM, Goldin JG, Hood J, Pitman J, de Los Rios M, Hobbs BP, Yu-Lin AB, Buendia-Roldan I, Thien F, Song JW, Perea PC, Ramírez-Rivera A, DiFrancesco A	The hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway promotes fibrosis in idiopathic       pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), an interstitial lung disease with a high mortality       rate. Currently, there is no cure for IPF, and available anti-fibrotics only slow       the rate of decline in lung function in IPF. We aimed to assess the safety and       efficacy of taladegib (ENV-101), an Hh pathway inhibitor, in IPF in a phase 2a,       proof-of-concept clinical trial. ENV-IPF-101 was a randomised,       double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial conducted at 16 clinical sites       in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, and South Korea for patients with IPF       older than 40 years who were not treated with concurrent IPF therapy. Patients       were randomly assigned to taladegib 200 mg or placebo equivalent once daily,       orally for 12 weeks, with a 6-week follow-up. The primary outcomes were safety in       the intention-to-treat population and change from baseline in forced vital       capacity (FVC) in the efficacy-evaluable population. Exploratory outcomes were       measures of fibrosis on high-resolution CT (HRCT) in the efficacy-evaluable       population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04968574.       Between Aug 12, 2021, and July 28, 2023, 41 patients were randomly       assigned to the taladegib group (n=21; three [14%] female and 18 [86%] male) or       the placebo group (n=20; four [20%] female and 16 [80%] male). All       treatment-emergent adverse events possibly or probably related to the study drug       were grade 1 or 2, all except one were mild or moderate in severity, and none       were serious adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in       the taladegib group were dysgeusia (12 [57%] of 21), muscle spasms (12 [57%] of       21), and alopecia (11 [52%] of 21); none of these events were reported in the       placebo group, for which the most common adverse events reported were diarrhoea       (four [20%] of 20), headache (three [15%] of 20), and dizziness (one [5%] of 20).       Patients treated with taladegib had an improvement from baseline in FVC and       across multiple HRCT-based measures of disease. Between-group differences in       change from baseline to week 12 favoured taladegib for the efficacy measures of       percent predicted FVC (3·95% [95% CI 0·31-7·60]; p=0·035; mean change from       baseline of 1·9% in the taladegib group vs -1·3% for placebo), total lung       capacity by HRCT (257·0 mL [95% CI 86·8-427·2]; p=0·0040; mean change from       baseline of 206·67 mL in the taladegib group vs -55·58 mL in the placebo group),       and percent quantitative interstitial lung disease (p=0·047; mean change from       baseline of -9·4% in the taladegib group vs 1·1% in the placebo group). No deaths       occurred during the trial. The acceptable safety profile and       efficacy analyses of taladegib support further investigation in a phase 2b trial       in patients with IPF (WHISTLE-PF). Endeavor BioMedicines.	The Lancet.

10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.08.066	Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy after stereotactic radiosurgery for       brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer: final results of the phase 3       METIS study.	Mehta MP, Gondi V, Ahluwalia MS, Roberge D, Sio TTW, Trifiletti DM, Muanza T, Krpan AM, Zhu Z, Ramakrishna NR, Fiveash JB, Metellus P, Yu J, Wang CJ, Jacob J, Freyschlag CF, Csőszi T, Salmaggi A, Taliansky A, Lucas A, Debus J, Brown PD, Harat M	Improved treatments for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer       (NSCLC BM) are needed to prolong time to intracranial progression without       increasing neurotoxicity. TTFields, are electric fields delivered via skin-based       arrays that disrupt cancer cell division, have demonstrated efficacy and safety       in glioblastoma, NSCLC, and pancreatic cancer. In the       phase 3 METIS trial (NCT02831959) adults with 1-10 newly-diagnosed NSCLC BM       suitable for SRS receiving optimal therapy for extracranial disease were       randomized 1:1 to SRS followed by TTFields (150 kHz) or SRS alone. Radiologic       progression was assessed by an independent radiology review committee. Primary       endpoint was time to intracranial progression (TTIP; RANO-BM). Secondary       endpoints included overall survival, neurocognitive function, quality of life       (QoL), and safety. Patients (N=298) were followed for a median of 8.6       (0.07-85.2) months. TTFields significantly delayed TTIP (HR 0.72 [95% CI       0.53-0.98]; Fine-Gray P=0.044). Intracranial progression rates at months 2, 6,       12, and 24 were 13.6% vs 22.1% (P=0.034), 33.7% vs 46.4% (P=0.018), 46.9% vs       59.4% (P=0.023), and 53.6% vs 65.2% (P=0.031; post hoc). Time to distant       intracranial progression (TTDP) favored TTFields therapy, although not       statistically significantly (HR 0.76 [0.51-1.12]; log-rank P=0.165; post-hoc). In       patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI; n=118), the delays in both       TTIP (HR 0.63 [0.39-1.0]; Cox P=0.049; Fine-Gray P=0.055) and TTDP (HR 0.41       [0.21-0.81]; log-rank P=0.0087, post-hoc) were more pronounced. Device-related       AEs were mainly grade ≤2 skin events. TTFields did not cause QoL deterioration,       and improvements in deterioration-free survival and time to deterioration of the       global health status, physical functioning and fatigue domains were observed       (post-hoc). By significantly prolonging TTIP, without worsening QoL       or cognitive function, TTFields after SRS is a new treatment option for patients       with NSCLC BM, including those receiving ICI.

10.1186/s12943-025-02467-8	Non-coding RNAs in gastric cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.	Han Z, Liu W, Zhu Y, Sun Y, Sun D, Jia R, Yang Y, Qi H, Zhang L, Huo Y, Zhang N, Chai J, Yang M	Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of       cancer-related deaths worldwide. It is associated with high molecular and       phenotypic heterogeneity. Early-stage gastric cancer can be treated with       endoscopic resection and surgery, whereas at its advanced stage, sequential       chemotherapy presents the only treatment option, which starts with first-line       platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based dual drugs, supporting a median survival       period of less than one year. Targeted monoclonal antibodies approved for the       treatment of gastric cancer are effective for a limited subset of patients.       Furthermore, painless and precise markers for the early detection of gastric       cancer and new targets for its treatment are unavailable. Interestingly, many       non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs       (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play key roles in the development of       gastric cancer. Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that ncRNAs play a crucial       role in the treatment of gastric cancer using chemotherapy and targeted therapy       drugs. In this article, we systematically reviewed the important roles of ncRNAs       in chemotherapy resistance, immune escape, metabolism, and angiogenesis of       gastric cancer, and systematically elucidated the relevant molecular mechanisms.       In addition, we also proposed the potential clinical significance of ncRNA as a       new therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.	Molecular cancer	03/10/2025
10.1126/sciadv.adv2283	Meiotic cohesin RAD21L shapes 3D genome structure and transcription in the male       germline.	Marín-Gual L, Vara C, Sainz-Urruela R, Cuartero Y, Álvarez-González L, Felipe-Medina N, Garcia F, Llano E, Marti-Renom MA, Pendás AM, Ruiz-Herrera A	The distinctive three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture adopted by       chromosomes during meiosis is essential for fertility, yet the functional       implications of the fine-scale spatial organization remain poorly understood.       Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin       subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line.       Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome       conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L       deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal       interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet       formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous       chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by       detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary       spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings       establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of       genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of       the male germline transcriptional landscape.

Kucuk NO, Coskun N, Araz M, Alan Selcuk N, Berberoglu K, Ozdemir EC, Gumuser FG, Kuyumcu S, Sezgin C, Sanli O, Sanli Y, Sendur MAN, Urun Y	(161)Tb is a theranostic radionuclide that emits both β(-) particles and Auger       electrons with high linear energy transfer, potentially enhancing cytotoxicity in       micrometastatic disease. We report the first multicenter clinical experience of       [(161)Tb]Tb-PSMA in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer       (mCRPC) refractory to [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy. Methods: This prospective,       multicenter study included 7 patients with mCRPC who had progressed despite prior       androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, taxane-based chemotherapy, and at least 2       cycles of [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA. All patients had PSMA-positive disease without any       [(18)F]FDG-discordant lesions. Each received 2 cycles of [(161)Tb]Tb-PSMA (7.4       GBq per cycle, 6-wk interval). Response was assessed with [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT       per RECIP 1.0 and prostate-specific antigen kinetics. Posttherapy dosimetry was       performed using SPECT/CT imaging at 4 time points. Results: Of the 7 patients, 4       (57%) demonstrated objective imaging response and 4 (57%) showed at least a 50%       decline in prostate-specific antigen levels. Treatment was well tolerated, with       only mild adverse events (grades 1-2) and no toxicity greater than grade 3. Organ       dosimetry confirmed favorable absorbed dose distributions. Conclusion:       [(161)Tb]Tb-PSMA demonstrated promising molecular and biochemical activity with a       favorable safety profile in patients who had progressed after [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA       therapy. These preliminary findings support further investigation of       (161)Tb-based radiopharmaceuticals as next-generation therapeutic options for       mCRPC.

10.1053/j.seminhematol.2025.08.003	The immunotherapy landscape in AML: Defining knowledge gaps toward rational       combinatorial strategies.	Subklewe M, Rutella S, Curti A	Immunotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes in lymphoid malignancies. In B       cell cancers, CD19-directed CAR T cells and T-cell engagers have produced high       remission rates and durable responses, now forming the cornerstone of treatment       in many relapsed or refractory settings. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia       (AML) has not experienced a comparable breakthrough. To date, only antibody-drug       conjugates have reached regulatory approval, with gemtuzumab ozogamicin approved       in combination with intensive induction and consolidation therapy for newly       diagnosed CD33-positive AML. This divergence is rooted in the biological and       immunologic complexity of AML. Unlike B-cell malignancies with lineage-restricted       surface markers such as CD19, AML lacks leukemia-specific antigens. Most targets       are shared with normal hematopoietic progenitors, leading to       on-target/off-leukemia toxicity. Moreover, AML exerts local and systemic       immunosuppression through both tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms,       limiting T-cell persistence and function. This review will introduce the current       immunotherapy platforms under investigation in AML, starting with antibody-based       approaches, followed by T-cell redirecting therapies, and culminating in an       overview of immune resistance, the bone marrow microenvironment, and strategies       toward personalized combinatorial immunotherapy. By synthesizing recent clinical       data and mechanistic insights, including those from early CAR and T-cell engager       trials, we aim to provide a translational framework for how immunotherapy might       still reshape AML care-through integration of immune contexture of the bone       marrow environment aiming for rational combinatorial approaches.

10.1089/vim.2019.0055	Effective Neutralizing Antibody Produced in Mice Directly Immunized with       Integrated Pichia pastoris Expressing HPV16L1 Protein.	Xv Z, Lv J, Jiang J, Wang W, Feng F, Zhang L, Xue X, Li W	The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has not been widely used in developing       countries because of its high cost and multiple subtype restrictions. The present       study aimed to develop an economical, convenient, and effective vaccine to       produce neutralizing antibodies. Using late protein 1 (L1) from the HPV16 subtype       as the target antigen (HPV16L1) and Pichia pastoris as the antigen release       system, integrated P. pastoris expressing HPV16L1 (named yeast-HPV16L1) was       prepared and vaccinated directly into mice by subcutaneous multipoint injection.       After immunization was performed thrice, high titers (greater than 1:40,960) of       specific anti-HPV16L1 antibodies were obtained in immune serum and were observed       to continuously rise over time. The indirect hemagglutination test and indirect       hemagglutination inhibition test were used to detect neutralizing antibody       activity in vitro, and the results demonstrated the hemagglutination ability of       the immune serum and the reduction in or loss of the hemagglutination ability if       preneutralized antigen was added to the immune serum. The protection conferred by       immune serum to tumor-bearing mice at the early stages was confirmed, but the       neutralizing activity disappeared when the tumor reached a size of 1 mm(3). The       neutralization activity of the immune serum was confirmed both in vitro and in       vivo.	Viral immunology	01/01/2019
10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf667	Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: from cause to novel treatments.	Fontana M, Aimo A, Emdin M, Porcari A, Solomon SD, Hawkins PN, Gillmore JD	Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a progressive disorder marked       by amyloid deposition in the heart, ultimately impairing cardiac function. Recent       treatment advances have paralleled an evolving understanding of ATTR-CM       pathophysiology. One emerging hypothesis suggests that an imbalance between in       vivo amyloid production and natural clearance may drive disease progression, a       conceptual framework that still requires validation. Transthyretin (TTR)       stabilizers, such as tafamidis and acoramidis, mitigate amyloid formation by       promoting the native tetrameric conformation of circulating TTR, thereby slowing       functional decline and prolonging survival. Similarly, TTR gene silencers inhibit       hepatic TTR synthesis, and gene-editing therapy with nexiguran ziclumeran offers       an additional strategy to reduce amyloid production. However, these approaches do       not enhance the body's limited capacity to clear existing amyloid deposits,       underscoring the need for novel agents that accelerate amyloid removal.       Promisingly, monoclonal antibodies targeting TTR amyloid are under development,       with early clinical trials suggesting that this passive immunotherapy may reverse       disease progression and improve heart function. Ultimately, optimal management of       ATTR-CM will require further elucidation of the complex interplay between amyloid       formation, its structural and functional impacts, its clearance mechanisms, and       the potential for myocardial reverse remodelling.

10.1007/s40259-025-00744-y	Biological Therapies in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: New Directions in       Personalised Respiratory Medicine.	Mappin-Kasirer B, Pavord ID	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of global morbidity       and mortality, is a complex and heterogeneous respiratory condition characterised       by incompletely reversible airflow obstruction on spirometry. The aetiologies and       pathological patterns of COPD are varied, which has long been viewed as a       hindrance to targeted treatment. Yet inflammation is central to the diverse       mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis, and type 2 inflammation has emerged as a       measurable, modifiable and clinically meaningful therapeutic target in those       patients in whom it is identified. The approval of first biological therapy       against type 2 inflammation in COPD builds on our understanding of immunological       mechanisms in airways diseases, is informed by a decade of randomised trials and       makes possible a fundamental shift in our approach to this common condition. This       review will (1) assess aspects of pathological inflammation in COPD, namely type       1, 2 and 3 inflammation, and the role of epithelial alarmins; (2) examine data       from randomised trials on the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies       against inflammatory mediators in COPD; and (3) discuss future directions for       biological therapies in COPD, including new patient populations, new agents and       new approaches that focus on high-risk disease and open the door to prevention.

10.1038/s41598-025-17908-z	Dynamics of detergent-resistant membranes of Plasmodium falciparum during blood       stage development.	Sferra G, Fratini F, Birago C, Megliorini L, Mochi S, Lalle M, Paone S, Olivieri A, Ferreri C, Sansone A, Ponzi M, Currà C, Pizzi E	Membrane microdomains, also known as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), are       tightly packed assemblies enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, where       various membrane-associated processes occur. Many intracellular pathogens,       including Plasmodium, exploit these raft-like structures to recognize and invade       host cells. In particular, Plasmodium depends on host cholesterol to build its       own membranes, as it is unable to perform sterol synthesis. Using quantitative       proteomics, lipid analysis, and bioinformatics, this study defines the       composition and dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum DRMs from key developmental       stages: schizonts, which give rise to invasive merozoites, and gametocytes, which       are responsible for transmission to the mosquito vector. Comparative analysis of       the flotation properties of DRM-associated proteins and lipids reveals both       conserved and stage-specific features in the structural organization of membrane       microdomains. Following parasite invasion, host DRMs are also remodeled with the       internalization of components of the erythrocyte junctional complex and their       repositioning in the newly generated parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Prediction       and analysis of the DRM interactomes reveals a core of proteins involved in       fundamental biological processes maintained between the schizont and gametocyte       stages. This common core forms a highly interconnected subnetwork that occupies a       central position in the interactomes, while stage-specific functions occupy a       peripheral position in the network.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.34927	Memantine to Treat Social Impairment in Youths With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A       Randomized Clinical Trial.	Joshi G, Gönenc A, DiSalvo M, Faraone SV, Ceranoglu TA, Yule AM, Uchida M, McDougle CJ, Wozniak J	Pharmacologic interventions for addressing social impairments in       autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are lacking. Proton magnetic resonance       spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies in individuals with ASD have documented altered       glutamate levels in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). To evaluate the safety and efficacy of memantine for treating social impairments       in youths with ASD and to explore pgACC glutamate levels as a potential biomarker       for treatment response. DESIGN, SETTING, This 12-week,       placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-design randomized clinical trial was       conducted between January 20, 2015, and July 11, 2018. The study population       comprised youths aged 8 to 17 years with ASD without intellectual disability       (IQ≥85) recruited from ambulatory psychiatry clinics at an academic institution.       Age- and sex-matched healthy control participants provided reference data for       pgACC glutamate levels. Data analysis was conducted between January 7, 2020, and       December 19, 2024. Participants with ASD were randomized to       memantine or placebo, with dose titration up to 20 mg/d. 1H-MRS scans were       acquired to assess pgACC glutamate levels. Response       was defined a priori as (1) a 25% or greater reduction in informant-rated Social       Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition total scores and (2) a clinician-rated       Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale (anchored for ASD) score of 2 or       less. The association between pgACC glutamate levels and treatment response was       explored using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This study included 42 youths with ASD who initiated treatment (mean [SD] age,       13.2 [2.6] years; 32 males [76.2%]). Of these youths, 35 were included in the       intention-to-treat efficacy analysis (n = 16 treated with memantine and 19 with       placebo), and 33 completed the trial (n = 16 treated with memantine and 17 with       placebo). Significantly more memantine-treated participants met the response       criteria compared with placebo-treated participants (9 of 16 [56.2%] vs 4 of 19       [21.0%]; odds ratio, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.1-21.2]; P = .03). Memantine was well       tolerated and did not have significantly more adverse events compared with       placebo. Mean (SD) pgACC glutamate levels were significantly higher in youths       with ASD vs healthy control participants (95.5 [14.6] IU vs 76.6 [17.7] IU;       standardized mean difference, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.8 to -0.6]; P < .001). Abnormally       elevated pgACC glutamate levels (≥1 SD above that of healthy control       participants) were observed in 20 of 37 participants (54.0%) with ASD and were       associated with more treatment responders to memantine than placebo (8 of 10       [80.0%] vs 2 of 10 [20.0%]; odds ratio, 16.0 [95% CI, 1.8-143.2]; P = .007). ROC       curve analysis indicated that pgACC glutamate levels were highly efficient at       identifying treatment responders. In this trial,       memantine was well tolerated and significantly improved social impairments in       youths with ASD. Elevated pgACC glutamate levels were associated with a favorable       treatment response, supporting their potential as a biomarker for assessing       memantine efficacy in individuals with ASD.

10.1186/s12967-025-07053-6	CBP/p300, a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer.	Xu H, Hou Y, Zhao Z, Zhang J, Li P, Cao Y, Nie X, Hou J	Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the most prevalent malignancy among men, with the       inevitable emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) presenting       the greatest challenge. Accumulating evidence has confirmed that the       overexpression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein       (CBP) and E1A-binding protein (p300), two highly homologous transcriptional       coactivators, plays a crucial role in the development of PCa and its progression       to CRPC, thereby making them prominent therapeutic targets for all types of PCa.       In this review, we systematically discuss the structure and function of CBP/p300       and elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which CBP/p300 promote prostate       carcinogenesis and development. Specifically, CBP/p300 facilitate prostate       carcinogenesis by acetylating specific lysine residues on essential transcription       factors involved in androgen receptor (AR) signaling, canonical Wnt signaling,       p53 signaling, as well as other pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling.       Additionally, they contribute to tumor immunosuppression and adaptive resistance       to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade treatment by inducing the       expression and secretion of the PD-L1 protein. Furthermore, we explore the latest       advances in the use of various inhibitors targeting different domains of CBP/p300       and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) degraders in PCa. We propose that       combing CBP/p300 inhibitors or degraders with current anti-PCa therapies,       including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy,       holds potential to overcome the challenges in treating advanced PCa and improve       clinical outcomes for all PCa patients.

10.1073/pnas.89.24.12180	Papillomavirus L1 major capsid protein self-assembles into virus-like particles       that are highly immunogenic.	Kirnbauer R, Booy F, Cheng N, Lowy DR, Schiller JT	Infection by certain human papillomavirus types is regarded as the major risk       factor in the development of cervical cancer, one of the most common cancers of       women worldwide. Analysis of the immunogenic and structural features of       papillomavirus virions has been hampered by the inability to efficiently       propagate the viruses in cultured cells. For instance, it has not been       established whether the major capsid protein L1 alone is sufficient for virus       particle assembly. In addition, it is not known whether L1, L2 (the minor capsid       protein), or both present the immunodominant epitopes required for induction of       high-titer neutralizing antibodies. We have expressed the L1 major capsid       proteins of bovine papillomavirus type 1 and human papillomavirus type 16 in       insect cells via a baculovirus vector and analyzed their conformation and       immunogenicity. The L1 proteins were expressed at high levels and assembled into       structures that closely resembled papillomavirus virions. The self-assembled       bovine papillomavirus L1, in contrast to L1 extracted from recombinant bacteria       or denatured virions, also mimicked intact bovine papillomavirus virions in being       able to induce high-titer neutralizing rabbit antisera. These results indicate       that L1 protein has the intrinsic capacity to assemble into empty capsid-like       structures whose immunogenicity is similar to infectious virions. This type of L1       preparation might be considered as a candidate for a serological test to measure       antibodies to conformational virion epitopes and for a vaccine to prevent       papillomavirus infection.

10.1002/cam4.71232	The Associations Between the TyG Index and the Risk of Cancer-A Systematic Review       and Meta-Analysis.	Li H, Chen Z, Jiang G, Yu W, Luo J, Li S, Xie L, Bai X, Xu Y, Jiang Y, He M, Mao M, Wang X	The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, a simple and reliable surrogate       marker of insulin resistance (IR), has garnered increasing attention in metabolic       research. Although IR is mechanistically linked to carcinogenesis through       multiple pathways, including chronic inflammation, hyperinsulinemia-driven       pro-mitogenic signaling, and altered adipokine secretion, the specific utility of       the TyG index for cancer risk assessment remains unclear. This systematic review       examines whether the TyG index shows consistent associations across cancer types       and holds value as an independent risk predictor beyond established metabolic       syndrome components. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web       of Science databases from 2008 (the year the TyG index was established as an IR       marker) to December 31, 2024, for studies on the TyG index-cancer association.       Cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies were included. Using       meta-analysis, we pooled effect sizes and conducted subgroup analyses by gender,       region, population source, and study design. Trial sequential analysis (TSA)       evaluated evidence reliability. This meta-analysis incorporated a total       of 20 eligible studies. Our findings demonstrated that elevated TyG index levels       were significantly associated with increased risks of various malignancies,       including digestive system cancers (1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.31), urogenital       system cancers (2.04, 95% CI 1.53-2.71), and breast cancer (1.64, 95% CI       1.49-1.80) when compared to lower TyG index levels. These associations remained       consistent across all pre-specified subgroup analyses stratified by study       characteristics. Furthermore, TSA confirmed sufficient statistical power for       definitive conclusions. The consistent observed association between       elevated TyG index and increased cancer risk highlights its potential as a       candidate biomarker for further investigation. While these findings support the       biological plausibility of insulin resistance in oncogenesis, current       evidence-partially derived from observational studies-cannot establish causality       or direct clinical utility. Future research should prioritize: (1) prospective       validation of TyG index thresholds for cancer risk prediction, (2) mechanistic       studies elucidating its role in tumor biology, and (3) assessment of its       incremental value to existing risk stratification tools.

10.1016/j.bneo.2025.100152	Ivosidenib or venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents in IDH1-mutated       acute myeloid leukemia: a real-world study.	Lachowiez CA, Smith BD, Ambinder AJ, Binder G, Angiolillo A, Potluri R, Papademetriou E, LeBlanc TW	Approximately 10% of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia       (ND-AML) harbor the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene mutation (mIDH1). In this       real-world study evaluating ivosidenib (IVO) + hypomethylating agents (HMAs; n =       181) vs venetoclax (VEN) + HMAs (n = 99) in patients with mIDH1 ND-AML, those       treated with IVO+HMA had higher rates of complete remission (CR; 42.5% vs 26.3%;       P = .007), higher rates of composite CR + CR with incomplete platelet count       recovery (63.0% vs 48.5%; P = .019), shorter median time to best response (3.3 vs       4.1 months; P = .006), and improved 6-month event-free survival (55.8% vs 38.4%;       P = .006). Most patients treated with VEN received well under 28 days of VEN per       cycle, likely due to anticipation of toxicity; outcomes with this short-schedule       VEN were proportionately worse with fewer days of exposure per cycle. The       between-group rate of grade ≥3 adverse events was similar within 30 days of       treatment initiation, except for higher rates of febrile neutropenia for VEN+HMA       vs IVO+HMA (8.1% vs 1.7%; P = .008). These findings support results from the       phase 3 AGILE trial demonstrating IVO+HMA's efficacy and favorable toxicity       profile in patients with mIDH1 ND-AML. IVO + azacitidine should be considered as       the preferred standard of care treatment regimen in this patient subgroup.	Blood neoplasia	01/01/2025
10.3324/haematol.2025.288553	Long-term outcomes in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia after frontline       hypomethylating agent, venetoclax and a FLT3 inhibitor.	Short NJ, Loghavi S, Yilmaz M, Karrar O, Kim K, Dinardo CD, Kadia TM, Maroun M, Borthakur G, Issa GC, Jabbour J, Oran B, Shpall EJ, Popat U, Patel KP, Routbort M, Konopleva M, Ravandi F, Kantarjian H, Daver N	Triplet regimens with a hypomethylating agent, venetoclax and a FLT3 inhibitor       yield high rates of response in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. However, the       long-term outcomes and patterns of relapse with these triplet regimens are not       well-established. In this retrospective analysis, 73 patients with newly       diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML received a frontline FLT3 inhibitor-containing triplet       regimen. The composite complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic       recovery (CRi) rate was 93%. Next-generation sequencing FLT3-ITD MRD negativity       (sensitivity: 0.005%) was achieved in 60% of patients after cycle 2 and 90% after       cycle 4. The estimated 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) for FLT3-ITD-mutated       and FLT3 TKD-mutated AML was 38% and 76%, respectively, and the 3-year overall       survival (OS) was 45% and 76%, respectively. Neither age, NPM1 co-mutation, ELN       2022 risk, nor allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission       significantly impacted OS. Baseline RAS pathway mutations were associated with       poor long-term survival (3-year OS 22% versus 63% without RAS pathway mutation).       FLT3 wild type relapses accounted for 65% of relapses, and new RAS pathway       mutations were observed in 24% of relapses. Outcomes were poor after relapse       (median OS of 6.1 months), particularly for those with persistently detectable       FLT3 mutations. Triplet combinations of an HMA, venetoclax and a FLT3 inhibitor       result in durable remission and encouraging long-term OS in older adults with       newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. However, better strategies to prevent FLT3 wild       type relapses and to overcome RAS pathway-mediated resistance are still needed.	Haematologica	02/10/2025
10.3389/fmed.2025.1638496	Relative efficacy of minoxidil in combination with other treatments for       androgenic alopecia: a network meta-analysis based on randomized controlled       trials.	Xia Y, Chen H, Chen Y, Chen Z	Androgenetic alopecia is the most prevalent form of progressive hair       loss. Minoxidil is widely regarded as a standard treatment for this condition.       Consequently, we assessed the effectiveness of minoxidil in combination with       other pharmacological agents for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. A comprehensive search was conducted across four databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of       Science, and Cochrane Library-on December 10, 2024. Eligible studies were       selected based on the PICOS framework. Data extraction and synthesis were carried       out using a Bayesian network meta-analysis, focusing on mean difference and       sample size data. League tables and Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA)       values were employed to evaluate the relative efficacy of the interventions.       Among the 20 study groups analyzed, the combination of platelet-rich       plasma and basic fibroblast growth factor with minoxidil demonstrated the highest       overall efficacy (SUCRA = 93.06%). This combination resulted in a mean increase       in hair density of 35.12 hairs/cm(2) compared to the group treated with minoxidil       alone. In male subgroups, finasteride combined with minoxidil was the most       effective treatment (SUCRA = 80.18%). Among seven combination therapies for       females, microneedle with minoxidil proved most effective (SUCRA = 87.18%).       This study establishes a clinically actionable hierarchy of       minoxidil-based combination therapies, providing evidence-based guidance for       dermatologists to optimize androgenetic alopecia management. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024623164, identifier       CRD42024623164.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.35119	Traumatic Brain Injury and Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.	Zhu X, Russell ER, Lyall DM, Ho F, Mackay DF, Pell JP, Stewart W	History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or repetitive head impacts is       associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. This association       has attracted attention in recent years through the relationship between contact       sports participation and the increased risk of a number of neurodegenerative       diseases, including motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).       However, to date, the association between TBI in the community and ALS risk       remains uncertain. To leverage population-level health records to       explore the association between a history of TBI and subsequent ALS risk. DESIGN,       SETTING, This retrospective cohort study accessed UK-wide       electronic health record (EHR) data from individuals 18 years or older with TBI       history and age-, sex-, and area deprivation-matched general population       comparators. EHR data were available from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020,       with database interrogation performed on February 11, 2021, and data analysis       conducted between June 1, 2023, and October 3, 2024. Documented history       of TBI. Outcomes were obtained by individual-level       linkage to EHR data available via Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Risk of       ALS was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models to investigate       its association with TBI. Overall, 85 690 adults with a history of TBI       and 257 070 matched adults with no history of TBI were included, for a total of       342 760 participants (50.1% male; mean [SD] age, 50.7 [17.6] years). During a       median 5.72 (IQR, 3.07-8.82) years of follow-up, providing 2.13 million       person-years of follow-up, 150 incident ALS cases were recorded, resulting in       7.05 cases per 100 000 person-years. Risk of ALS was higher among individuals       with a history of TBI compared with individuals without a TBI history (hazard       ratio [HR], 2.61; 95% CI, 1.88-3.63). However, this association was time       dependent, with risk confined to the 2 years following TBI (HR, 6.18; 95% CI,       3.47-11.00), but not thereafter. In this retrospective       cohort study of 342 760 adults, an association between TBI and subsequent risk of       ALS was identified. However, this association was confined to the 2 years       immediately following injury. As such, the association between TBI and higher ALS       risk may indicate reverse causality, with TBI in some individuals perhaps       reflecting a consequence of early, subclinical ALS.

10.1186/s12888-025-07387-x	Association between sleep duration, depression and cognitive decline       trajectories: findings from a prospective cohort study in China.	Li C, Wu X, Li Y, Zhang M, Zhang L, Zhou C, Ma F	This study investigated the relationship between sleep duration and       cognitive decline trajectories among Chinese adults with age ≥ 45. Additionally,       it examined whether baseline depression symptoms mediated the association between       sleep duration and cognitive decline trajectories. Data came from the       China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally survey of       Chinese adults. Total sleep duration was grouped into shorter (≤ 6 h), normal       (6-9 h), and longer (> 9 h). Nighttime sleep duration was categorized as shorter       (≤ 6 h), normal (6-8 h), and longer (> 8 h). Daytime nap duration was classified       into no nap, shorter (≤ 0.5 h), normal (0.5-1.5 h), and longer (> 1.5 h).       Cognitive decline trajectories were identified using a group-based trajectory       model (GBTM). Depression symptoms, measured by baseline depression scores, were       included as a potential mediating variable. Multinomial logistic regression       models were applied to analyze the association between sleep duration and       cognitive trajectories. A total of 4,094 respondents were included.       Participants were classified into three trajectory groups: high-level stable       (n = 1,278, 31.2%), moderate-level slow-decline (n = 2,089, 51.0%), and low-level       rapid-decline (n = 727, 17.8%). Compared to the stable group, shorter total sleep       duration was associated with both rapid-decline (1.510; 95%1.079,2.114)       and slow-decline (1.466; 95%1.145,1.877) cognitive trajectories.       Similarly, shorter nighttime sleep duration was associated with both       rapid-decline (1.572; 95%1.089,2.271) and slow-decline (1.480;       95%1.129,1.939) cognitive trajectories compared to the stable group. Baseline       depression symptoms did not mediate these relationships (P > 0.05). Shorter total sleep duration (≤ 6 h) and shorter nighttime sleep duration (≤ 6 h)       were significantly associated with cognitive decline trajectories. However,       baseline depression symptoms did not mediate these relationships.	BMC psychiatry	01/10/2025
10.7150/thno.117202	Hsa_circ_0058495-mediated IGF2BP2 ubiquitination and m6A modification of MEKK1       promote the progression of PDAC.	Lv S, Zhang J, Peng X, Liu H, Chu T, Liu Z, Duan K, Guo J, Wang J, Liu Y, Wei F	Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive       malignancy with dismal clinical outcomes. We identified hsa_circ_0058495 as       significantly upregulated in PDAC tissues and PDAC cell-derived exosomes, where       it contributes to tumor proliferation and invasion. The molecular mechanisms       underlying its oncogenic function, however, remain incompletely understood.       Methods: Differential circRNA expression was profiled by RNA sequencing. The       functional role of hsa_circ_0058495 and its molecular interactions were       interrogated through Western blotting, RT-qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA       pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Confocal microscopy and PET/CT       imaging were employed to delineate its biological effects in vitro and in vivo.       Results: Hsa_circ_0058495 was enriched in PDAC-derived exosomes and stabilized       IGF2BP2 by preventing TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and attenuating       autophagy-dependent degradation. Stabilized IGF2BP2 enhanced the stability of       MEKK1 mRNA, leading to sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation and consequent promotion       of PDAC cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, exosomal hsa_circ_0058495       facilitated M2 macrophage polarization, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive       tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: Hsa_circ_0058495 promotes PDAC progression       by stabilizing IGF2BP2 and activating the MEKK1-ERK signaling cascade, while       exosomal transfer of hsa_circ_0058495 drives M2 macrophage polarization to       reinforce tumor-associated immunosuppression. These findings establish       hsa_circ_0058495 as a pivotal regulator of PDAC progression and underscore its       potential utility as both a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target.

10.1186/s12885-025-14791-9	Real-world management strategies and clinical outcomes of metastatic       HER2-positive breast cancer in Greece in the second-line setting and beyond (the       togetHER study).	Korantzis I, Koumarianou A, Rapti V, Timotheadou E, Christodoulou C, Tryfonopoulos D, Karageorgopoulou S, Boukovinas I, Zagouri F, Nikolaidi A, Papazisis K, Razis E, Barbounis V, Christopoulou A, Mavroudis D, Georgoulias V, Kesisis G, Papadopoulos EI, Michalea R, Ardavanis A	In the realm of HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC),       the advent of targeted therapies, notably trastuzumab and pertuzumab, represents       a substantial advancement in enhancing patient outcomes. However, the intricacies       of treatment escalate when patients encounter progression or resistance during       first-line (1L) therapy. The togetHER study aimed to elucidate real-world       insights into the profile, management strategies, and outcomes for HER2+ MBC       patients initiating second-line treatment (2LT) in Greece, predating recent       international guideline changes incorporating trastuzumab deruxtecan and       tucatinib in the second line and beyond lines of treatments. Data from       adult female patients with HER2+ MBC who had initiated 2LT between 01-Jan-2015       and 31-Dec-2018 in 18 oncology departments across Greece were retrospectively       abstracted through medical chart review. The eligible population       comprised 122 patients, 68.0% of whom presented with recurrent MBC. Among the       latter, 26.5% were tested for HER2 both in early and metastatic settings with       27.3% of them changing HER2 status from negative to positive. Retesting of HER2       expression following 2LT initiation was recorded in 8 cases. At 2LT initiation,       patients' median age was 57.0 years and 63.6% were hormone receptor-positive. The       most common metastatic sites were bone (56.6%), lung (44.3%), liver (41.0%), and       brain (29.5%). Anti-HER2 agent usage in 1L and 2L stood at 91.8% and 92.6%,       respectively, with rates slightly diminishing in third (3L) (85.9%) and fourth       line (4L) (82.4%). Endocrine therapy administration was generally low across       treatment lines (12.3%, 9.9%, and 5.9%, in 2L, 3L, and 4L respectively), while       chemotherapy use increased from 30.3% in 2L to 47.9% and 47.1% to 3L and 4L,       correspondingly. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for 2L, 3L, and 4L was       7.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.0-14.4], 6.4 (95% CI 5.4-7.1), and 5.6 (95%       CI 2.6-9.0) months, respectively, while median overall survival was 25.0 (95% CI       20.5-34.4) months. Although the 2LT pattern in Greece generally       aligned with guidelines, persistently poor treatment outcomes underscore a       significant unmet medical need for these patients.

10.1186/s40164-025-00710-y	Phase II study of zevorcabtagene autoleucel, a fully human BCMA-targeting CAR T       cell therapy, in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.	Chen W, Fu C, Fang B, Liang A, Xia Z, He Y, Lu J, Liu H, Hou M, Cai Z, Yang W, Hao S, Jiang S, Jing H, Liu J, Du X, Fu R, Mei H, Zhu Z, Yang Y, Liu H, Meng X, Rajakumaraswamy N, Yuan D, Wang H, Li Z	Zevorcabtagene autoleucel (zevor-cel) is a fully human autologous CAR       T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen approved in China since 2024       for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). LUMMICAR       STUDY 1 is a phase 2, single-arm study conducted across 23 centers in China. RRMM       patients aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 75 years with measurable disease who had received ≥ 3       prior lines of therapy, with adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve,       with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-1, were eligible.       Patients previously treated with any CAR T-cell therapy, or any BCMA-directed       therapy were ineligible. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR)       determined by an Independent Review Committee. The secondary endpoints included       ORR determined by investigator, additional efficacy outcomes including complete       response (CR)/ stringent complete response (sCR) rate, duration of response       (DOR), minimal residual disease negativity, safety outcomes including incidence       and severity of adverse events, and pharmacokinetics of zevor-cel. Overall, 125 patients underwent apheresis, 105 patients received lymphodepletion,       102 patients (median age of 59.5 [range: 38, 75] years; 53.9% male and 46.1%       female) received zevor-cel. The ORR was 92.2% (95% CI 85.13-96.55) with 70       patients (68.6%) achieving sCR and 3 (2.9%) achieving CR. At a median follow-up       of 20.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 12.5, 23.8) months, 45 (44.1%)       progression-free survival (PFS) events and 20 (19.6%) overall survival (OS)       events were observed, the DOR, PFS and OS data were not mature. Cytokine release       syndrome was reported in 92 (90.2%) patients, with grade 3 or 4 events in 7       (6.9%) patients. Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome was       reported in 2 patients at grade 1; no zevor-cel-related grade ≥ 3 neurotoxicity       occurred. Zevor-cel induces deep and durable responses in heavily       pre-treated RRMM patients with a manageable safety profile.	Experimental hematology & oncology	30/09/2025

The emergence of non-cancer-related factors       and time-dependent trends underscores the need for advanced analytical frameworks       to unravel their complex interplay. We analyzed the Pembro-real 5Y       registry, a global real-world dataset of 1050 patients treated across 61       institutions in 14 countries with a long-term follow-up and a large panel of       baseline variables. Two complementary approaches were employed: ridge regression,       chosen for its ability to address multicollinearity while retaining       interpretability, and not another imputation method (NAIM), a transformer-based       artificial intelligence model designed to handle missing data without imputation.       Endpoints included risk of death at 6, 12, 24, 60 months and 5-year survival.       The ridge regression model achieved a c-statistic of 0.66 (95% 0.59       to 0.72) for the risk of death and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% 0.65 to 0.78) for 5-year survival, identifying Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group       Performance Status (ECOG-PS)≥2, increasing age, and metastatic burden as primary       risk factors. However, wide CIs for some predictors highlighted statistical       instability. NAIM demonstrated robust handling of missing data, with a c-index of       62.98±2.11 for risk of death and an AUC of 60.52±3.71 for 5-year survival. The       comprehensive SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed dynamic,       time-dependent patterns, with early mortality dominated by acute factors (eg,       ECOG-PS, steroids) and long-term outcomes increasingly influenced by systemic       health markers (eg, absence of hypertension, increasing body mass index).       Unexpected insights included the protective role of dyslipidemia (but not       statins) and the nuanced impact of smoking status, reflecting evolving disease       dynamics and host-tumor interplay. Our integrative framework       illuminates the complexity of long-term outcomes in patients with NSCLC treated       with pembrolizumab, uncovering dynamic, non-linear prognostication trends. This       analysis provides insights into patient trajectories, emphasizing the need for       holistic, long-term management strategies.	Journal for immunotherapy of cancer	29/09/2025
10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.178206	Statins activate temperature-gated transient receptor potential ion channels.	Oprita G, Domocos D, Selescu T, Paduraru A, Tunaru S, Leffler A, Babes A, Babes RM	Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administered to decrease levels of LDL       cholesterol and to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are       relatively well tolerated, adverse effects such as myalgia and painful peripheral       neuropathy have been reported. While the underlying cause has not been fully       elucidated, accumulating evidence shows that statins have numerous pleiotropic       effects including anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions in several animal pain       models. Here we report that some of the most extensively used statins activate       members of the temperature-gated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel       subfamily expressed in heterologous systems. All tested statins (simvastatin,       atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) activate human TRPA1 and, in addition, simvastatin       activates human TRPV1 and rosuvastatin activates human TRPM8. The activation of       TRPV1 by simvastatin is abolished in a capsaicin-insensitive mutant. Furthermore,       the sensitivities of both TRPV1 and TRPA1 to simvastatin are diminished in triple       cysteine mutants known to exhibit a reduced sensitivity to reactive oxygen       species. Rosuvastatin-induced activation of TRPM8 seems to involve an aspartate       residue which is essential for sensitivity to the synthetic TRPM8-agonist icilin.       In mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, simvastatin activates a       subpopulation of neurons which also respond to the TRPV1-agonist capsaicin or the       TRPA1-agonist allyl isothiocyanate. In addition, TRPM8 plays an important role       for the activation of a small population of DRG neurons by rosuvastatin. Taken       together, these results indicate that statins activate thermo-sensitive TRP       channels expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons. This property may explain some       of the pleiotropic effects of these widely used drugs.	European journal of pharmacology	01/10/2025
10.1016/j.yjmcc.2025.09.008	Decoding long COVID-associated cardiovascular dysfunction: Mechanisms, models,       and new approach methodologies.	Thomas D, Yang PC, Wu JC, Sayed N	The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection       extends well beyond the acute phase, with long-term sequelae affecting multiple       organ systems, most notably, the cardiovascular system. Long COVID, or post-acute       sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent symptoms       such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations, which can last for months       or even years after initial recovery. Increasing evidence implicates immune       dysregulation, endothelial dysfunction, persistent viral antigens, and       coagulopathy as central drivers of cardiovascular complications. Mechanistic       studies demonstrate that direct viral infection of cardiac and vascular cells,       along with autoantibody formation and cytokine-mediated injury, contribute to       myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and arrhythmias. Sex-based immunological       differences and underlying comorbidities further influence individual       susceptibility and disease trajectory. Large-scale epidemiological studies have       confirmed significantly increased risks of pericarditis, cardiomyopathy,       dysrhythmias, and heart failure among COVID-19 survivors. In parallel, the       emergence of advanced preclinical platforms, including patient-derived induced       pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cardiac organoids, engineered heart tissues,       and organ-on-a-chip systems has enabled mechanistic dissection of Long COVID       pathophysiology. These human-relevant models, when integrated with clinical       datasets and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics, offer powerful tools       for biomarker discovery, risk stratification, and precision therapeutic       development. This review synthesizes the current understanding of cardiovascular       involvement in Long COVID, highlights key mechanistic insights from both clinical       and preclinical studies, and outlines future directions for diagnostic and       therapeutic innovation.

10.1016/j.breast.2025.104588	Investigating the prognostic role of citrullination-related genes in breast       cancer by combining transcriptomics, single-cell analysis and verification.	He W, Fan S, Luo Y, Yi X, Liu Y, He G, Li Z, Li Y	Citrullination, a process linked to autoimmune diseases, has been implicated in       cancer, but its role in breast cancer (BRCA) remains unclear. This study aimed to       identify citrullination-related genes (CRGs) associated with prognosis in BRCA.       We utilized datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BRCA) and Gene Expression       Omnibus (GEO), pinpointing candidate genes by intersecting differentially       expressed genes (DEGs) from TCGA-BRCA with known CRGs. Prognostic CRGs were       selected using univariate Cox regression and Lasso regression analyses, and a       predictive nomogram was created based on independent prognostic factors       identified through multivariate Cox regression. Our findings revealed that SEZ6,       S100B, SPIB, and TFF1 were key CRGs used to construct a risk model. High-risk       BRCA patients exhibited immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs) with       low CD8(+) T cell mutation and enrichment in C1/C4 immune subtypes. In contrast,       low-risk patients displayed high immune infiltration and enrichment in C2/C3/C6       subtypes. High expression of S100B, SPIB, and TFF1 was associated with increased       immune infiltration by NK cells and T cells, while high SEZ6 expression was       linked to neutrophil mutations, PD-L1 upregulation, and low CD8(+) T cell       infiltration. Molecular docking studies explored the interactions of these CRGs       with entinostat. In conclusion, SEZ6, S100B, SPIB, and TFF1 were identified as       significant prognostic genes in BRCA, providing insights into BRCA pathogenesis       and potential personalized treatment strategies.

10.1002/1878-0261.70132	Characterizing epithelial-mesenchymal transition-linked heterogeneity in breast       cancer circulating tumor cells at a single-cell level.	Topa J, Richert J, Stokowy T, Staśczak A, Szajewski M, Ciesielski M, Grešner PM, Tomasik B, Arcimowicz Ł, Stankiewicz A, Suchodolska G, Senkus E, Kruszewski W, Żaczek AJ, Markiewicz A	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) generates heterogeneity in circulating       tumor cells (CTCs), affecting their biological properties and hampering their       detection. This limits our understanding of the mechanisms underlying       hematogenous dissemination, especially in early breast cancer (BC), where CTCs       are rare. Here, we aimed to detect CTCs with different EMT statuses from BC       patients. CTCs in blood samples from 107 BC patients were evaluated using       immunomagnetic depletion and multi-marker immunofluorescence (EpCAM, E-cadherin,       MCAM, cell surface vimentin, CD31, CD45), followed by single-cell       transcriptomics. CTCs were detected in 51.9% of therapy-naïve early BC cases,       with 3.8% showing only epithelial CTCs (eCTCs), 5.8% epithelial-mesenchymal       (emCTCs), 26.0% mesenchymal (mCTCs), and 16.3% mixed phenotypes. CTC       heterogeneity was more frequent in triple-negative (86%) than in luminal BC (17%,       P = 0.008). Lymph node involvement strongly predicted dissemination of all CTC       phenotypes, while tumor size correlated with mCTC abundance. Single-cell RNA       sequencing revealed downregulation of ribosomal genes and translation inhibition       in CTCs with mesenchymal features, linked to mTORC1 signaling. Findings were also       validated in an independent dataset, highlighting vulnerabilities in CTCs during       dissemination.	Molecular oncology	05/10/2025
10.1186/s12967-025-07030-z	MicroRNA signatures of cancer risk in kidney transplant patients: insights from       the COMETA study.	Simeoni M, Tufano R, Grandinetti V, Cossu AM, Alfieri C, Pollastro R, Calcutta A, Scrima M, Bocchetti M, Zappavigna S, Simeone I, Grandaliano G, Capasso A, Messa P, Castellano G, Mella A, Biancone L, Ceccarelli M, Caraglia M, La Manna G, Capasso G, Citterio F	Post-transplant malignancies are one of the leading causes of       morbidity, mortality and graft failure in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).       While viral infections and immunosuppressive drugs have historically been       considered primary causes, the mechanisms underlying post-transplant cancer       occurrence remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, predictive cancer       biomarkers have yet to be identified in KTRs. COMETA study is an       observational study involving 138 KTRs, and it aims to elucidate the interplay       between the immune system and cancer by integrating comprehensive clinical data       with high-throughput small-RNA sequencing on the serum of patients with       post-kidney transplant malignancies. Our results identified three       distinct serum miRNA profiles, respectively, associated with kidney       transplantation, pro-oncogenic and onco-protective factors in this unique       population. These profiles were also used to create miRNA classifiers, which       demonstrated promising predictive performance, especially for tumor-promoting       signatures. Notably, miR-210-3p up-regulation, within the cancer-related profile       was first found to be associated with non-melanoma skin cancer. These       findings could serve as a basis for future research, paving the way for the       development of advanced tools for early cancer diagnosis, precise prognosis       formulation, and the creation of targeted therapies for KTRs with neoplastic       complications.
